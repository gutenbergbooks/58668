<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Bristol Mail opened the mail-coach era by
going at eight miles an hour, but that was an
altogether exceptional speed, and the average
mail-coach journeys were not performed at a
rate of more than seven miles an hour until long
after the nineteenth century had dawned. In
1812, when Colonel Hawker travelled to Glasgow,
it took the mail 57 hours’ continuous unrelaxing
effort to cover the 404 miles—three nights and
two days’ discomfort. By 1836 the distance
had been reduced by eight miles, and the time
to 42 hours. By 1838 it was 41 hours 17 minutes.
Nowadays it can be done by quickest train in
exactly eight hours; the railway mileage 401½
miles. In 1812 it cost an inside passenger all
the way to Glasgow, for fare alone, exclusive of
tips to coachmen and guards, and the necessary
expenditure for food and drink all those weary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
hours, no less than £10 8<i>s.</i>; about 6⅙<i>d.</i> a mile.
To-day, £2 18<i>s.</i> franks you through, first-class;
or 33<i>s.</i> third—itself infinitely more luxurious
than even the consecrated inside of a mail-coach.</p>

<p>The mails starting from London were perfection
in coaches, harness and horses; but as
the distance from the Metropolis increased so
did the mails become more and more shabby.
Hawker, travelling north, found them slow and
slovenly, the harness generally second-hand, one
horse in plated, another in brass harness; and
when they <em>did</em> have new (which, he tells us, was
very seldom) it was put on like a labourer’s
leather breeches, and worn till it rotted, without
ever being cleaned.</p>

<p>Of course, very few people ever did, or could
have had the endurance to, travel all that distance
straight away, and so travel was further complicated,
delayed, and rendered more costly by
the halts necessary to recruit jaded nature.</p>

<p>Hawker evidently did it in four stages: to
Ferrybridge, 179 miles, where he rested the
first night and picked up the next mail the
following; thence the 65 miles onward to Greta
Bridge; on again, 59 miles, to Carlisle; and
thence, finally, to Glasgow in another 101 miles.
In his diary he gives “a table to show for how
much a gentleman and his servant (the former
inside, with 14 lb. of luggage; the latter outside,
with 7 lb.) may go from London to
Glasgow.”</p>

<p class="in0">Such were the costs and charges of a gentleman
travelling to pay a country visit in 1812,
exclusive of hotel bills for self and servant on
the way.</p>

<p>The great factor in the acceleration of the
mails was the improvement in the roads, a
work carried out by the Turnpike Trusts in
fear of the Post Office, whose surveyors had the
power, under ancient Acts, of indicting roads in
bad condition. Great bitterness was stirred up
over this matter. The growing commercial and
industrial towns—Glasgow prominent among
them—naturally desired direct mail-services, and
the Post Office, using their needs as means
for obtaining, not only roads kept in good condition,
but sometimes entirely new roads and
short cuts, declined to start such services until
such routes were provided. It was not within
the power of the Department to compel new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
roads, but only to see that the old ones were
maintained; but in the case of Glasgow, to
whose merchants a direct service meant much,
the Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, and
individual persons contributed large sums for
the improvement of the existing road between
that city and Carlisle, and a Turnpike Trust
was formed for one especial section, where the
road was entirely reconstructed. These districts
were wholly outside Glasgow’s sphere of responsibilities,
but all this money was expended for
the purpose of obtaining a direct mail through
Carlisle, instead of the old indirect one through
Edinburgh; and when obtained, of retaining it
in face of the continued threats of the Post Office
to take it off unless the road was still further
improved. It certainly does not seem to have
been a remarkably good road, even after these
improvements, for Colonel Hawker, travelling it
in 1812, describes it as being mended with large
soft quarry-stones, at first like brickbats and
afterwards like sand.</p>

<p>But the subscribers who had expended so
much were naturally indignant. They pointed
out that the district was a wild and difficult one
and the Trust poor, in consequence of the sparse
traffic. The stage-coaches, they said, had in
some instances been withdrawn because they could
not hold their own against the competition of
the mail, and the Trust lost the tolls in consequence;
while the mail, going toll-free and
wearing the road down, contributed nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the upkeep. They urged that the mail should
at least pay toll, and in this they were supported
by every other Turnpike Trust.</p>

<p>The exemption of mail-coaches from payment
of tolls, a relief provided for by the Act of 25th
George III., was really a continuation of the
old policy by which the postboys of an earlier
age, riding horseback and carrying the mailbags
athwart the saddle, had always passed toll-free.
Even the light mail-cart partook of this advantage,
to which there could then have been no real
objection. It had been no great matter, one
way or the other, with the Turnpike Trusts, for
the posts were then infrequent and the revenue
to be obtained quite a negligeable quantity; but
the appearance of mail-coaches in considerable
numbers, running constantly and carrying passengers,
and yet contributing nothing towards
the upkeep of the roads, soon became a very
real grievance to those Trusts situated on the
route of the mails, but in outlying parts of the
kingdom, little travelled, and where towns were
lacking and villages poor, few, and far between.
Little wonder, then, that the various Turnpike
Trusts in 1810 approached Parliament for a
redress of these disabilities. They pointed out
that not only was there a greater wear and tear
of the roads now the mail-coaches were running,
but that travellers, relying on the fancied security
of the mails, had deserted the stages, which
in many cases had been wholly run off the
road. Pennant, writing in 1792, tells how two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
stages plying through the county of Flint, and
yielding £40 in tolls yearly, had been unable
to compete with the mail, and were thus
withdrawn, to the consequent loss of the Trust
concerned. It was calculated, so early as 1791,
by one amateur actuary, that the total annual
loss through mail exemptions was £90,000; but
another put it at only £50,000 in 1810.</p>

<p>The case of the remote country trusts was
certainly a hard one. Like all turnpikes, they
were worked under Acts of Parliament, which
prescribed the amounts of tolls to be levied, and
they were, further, authorised to raise money for
the improvement of the roads on the security of
the income arising from these taxes upon locomotion.
The security of money sunk in these quasi-Government
enterprises had always been considered
so good that Turnpike Trust bonds and mortgages
were a very favourite form of investment; but
when Parliament turned a deaf ear to the bitter
cry of the remote Trusts, the position of those
interested in the securities began to be reconsidered.
The woes of these undertakings were
further added to by the action of the Post Office,
which, zealous for its new mail-services, sent out
emissaries to report upon the condition of the
roads. The reports of these officials bore severely
against the very Trusts most hardly hit by the
mail-exemption, and the roads under their control
were frequently indicted for being out of repair,
with the result that heavy fines were inflicted.
It had been suggested that as the Post Office on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7<br /><a id="Page_8">8</a><br /><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
one hand required better roads, and on the other
deprived the rural Trusts of a great part of their
income, the Government should at least pay off
the debts of the various turnpikes. But nothing
was done; the mails continued to go free, and
in the end the iniquity was perpetrated of suffering
the local Turnpike Acts to lapse and the
roads to be dispiked before the Trusts had paid
off their loans. The greater number of Trust
“securities” therefore became worthless, and the
investors in them ruined.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After J. A. Atkinson.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Mail-coaches continued to go toll-free to the
very last in England, although from 1798 they
had paid toll in Ireland. In Scotland, too, the
Trusts were treated with tardy justice, and in
1813 an Act was passed repealing the exemption
in that kingdom. But what the Post Office relinquished
with one hand it took back with the
other, clapping on a halfpenny additional postage
for each Scotch letter. It was like the children’s
game of “tit-for-tat.” But it did not end here.
The Trusts raised their tolls against the mail-coaches,
and smiled superior. It was then the
Department’s call, and it responded by immediately
taking off a number of the mails. That
ended the game in favour of St. Martin’s-le-Grand.</p>

<p>Although Parliament never repealed the
exemption for the whole of the United Kingdom,
it caused an estimate to be prepared of the annual
cost of paying tolls, should it ever be in a mind
to grant the Trusts that relief. It thus appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
from the return made in 1812, that the cost for
Scotland would have been £11,229 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>;
for England, £33,536 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; and for Wales,
£5224 3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>: total, £49,990 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The mails, travelling as they did throughout
the night, were subject to many dangers. They
were brilliantly lighted, generally with four, and
often with five, lamps, and cast a very dazzling
illumination upon the highway. It is true that
no certainty exists as to the number of lamps
mail-coaches carried, and that old prints often
show only two; so that the practice in this
important matter probably varied on different
routes and at various times. But the crack mails
at the last certainly carried five lamps—one on
either side of the fore upper quarter, one on
either side of the fore boot, and another under
the footboard, casting a light upon the horses’
backs and harness. These radiant swiftnesses,
hurtling along the roads at a pace considerably
over ten miles an hour, were highly dangerous
to other users of the roads, who were half-blinded
by the glare, and, alarmed by the heart-shaking
thunder of their approach and fearful of being
run down, generally drove into the ditches as
the least of two evils. The mails were then,
as electric tramcars and high-powered motor-cars
are now, the tyrants of the road.</p>

<p>But they were not only dangerous to others.
Circumstances that ought never to have been
permitted sometimes rendered them perilous to
all they carried. The possibilities of that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
in wrong-doing are shown in the practice of Sir
Watkin Williams Wynn (who assuredly was not
the only one) being allowed to send his refractory
carriage-horses to the mails, to be steadied. On
such occasions the passengers from Oswestry
found themselves in for a wild start and a rough
stage, and Sir Watkin had the steam taken out
of his high-mettled horses at an imminent risk
to the lives and limbs of the lieges.</p>

<p>From 1825, when the era of the fast day-coaches
began, the mails gradually lost the proud
pre-eminence they had kept for more than forty
years. Even though they had been accelerated
from time to time as roads improved, they went
no quicker than the new-comers, and very often
not so quick, from point to point. They suffered
the disabilities of travelling by night, when careful
coachmen dared not let their horses out to their
best speed, and of being subject to the delays of
Post Office business; and so, although they might,
and did, make wonderful speed between stages,
the showing on the whole journey could not
compare with the times of the fast day-coaches,
which halted only for changing horses and for
meals, and, enjoying the perfection of quick-changing,
often got away in fifty seconds from
every halt. Going at more seasonable hours, the
day-coaches now began to seriously compete with
the mails, whose old-time supporters, although
still sensible of the dignity of travelling by mail,
were equally alive to the comfort and convenience
of going by daylight. Modern writers, enlarging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
upon the times of our ancestors, lay great stress
upon the endurance our hearty grandfathers
“cheerfully” displayed, and show us great, bluff,
burly, red-cheeked men, who enjoyed this long
night-travelling. But that is an absurdity. They
did <em>not</em> enjoy it; they were not all bluff and
burly; and that they welcomed the change that
gave them swift travelling by day instead of night
is obvious from the instant success of the fast day-coaches,
and from the later business-history of the
mails. Mail-contractors, who in the prosperous
days of no competition were screwed down by the
Post Office to incredible mileage figures, began
to grumble; but for long they grumbled in vain.
Even in 1834 the Post Office continued to pay
only 2<i>d.</i> a mile on 42 mails, 1½<i>d.</i> a mile on 34,
and only one received as much as 4<i>d.</i> The Liverpool
and Manchester carried the mailbags for
nothing, and three actually paid the Post Office
for the privilege. At this time the old rule
forbidding more than three outside passengers
on the mails was relaxed. This indulgence began
in Scotland, where the contractors, in consideration
of the sparseness of the population and the
scarcity of chance passengers on the way, were
allowed a fourth outside passenger; and eventually
many of the mails, like the stages, carried
from eight to twelve outsides. This, however, did
not suffice, for those passengers did not often
present themselves; and at last the contractors
really did not care to obtain the Post Office
business, finding it pay better to devote their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13<br /><a id="Page_14">14</a><br /><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
attention to fast day-coaches on their own
account.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="in6">THE MAIL.</span>
<span class="fright"><i>After J. L. Agasse, 1824.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Thus the Post Office found itself in a novel
and unwonted position. Coach-proprietors and
contractors, instead of anxiously endeavouring to
obtain the mail-contracts, held aloof, and the Post
Office surveyors, when renewals were necessary,
found <em>they</em> had to make the advances and do the
courting. Then the tables were turned with a
vengeance! For Benjamin Horne’s “Foreign
Mail,” carrying what were called the “black
bags” (<i>i.e.</i> black tarpaulin to protect the mail
from sea-water) between London and Dover,
1<i>s.</i> 3¾<i>d.</i> per double mile was paid; 11⅙<i>d.</i> for the
Carmarthen and Pembroke; and 8<i>d.</i>, and then
9<i>d.</i>, for the Norwich Mail, by Newmarket,
strongly opposed as it was by the Norwich “Telegraph,”
and therefore loading badly on that lonely
road. For the Chester, originally contracted for
at 1<i>s.</i> a mile, then down to 3<i>d.</i>, and in 1826 up
to 4<i>d.</i>, 6<i>d.</i> was paid, on account of passengers
going by the direct Holyhead Mail, and the
Holyhead itself was raised to the same figure
when fast day-stages had begun to run from
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>A Committee of the House of Commons had
sat upon this question before these prices were
given, and much evidence was taken; but these
revised tariffs did by no means end the matter.
Substantial contractors would in many instances
have nothing to do with the Post Office, and the
Department could not run the risk of employing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
irresponsible men who could not be held to
their undertakings. In some few instances
ordinary night-stages were given the business,
and it was seriously proposed to employ the
guards of existing stage-coaches to take charge
of the bags, but this was never carried out. In
the midst of all these worries, when it seemed as
though the despatch of the mails must needs, in
the altered conditions of the time, be eventually
changed from night to day, railways came to
relieve official anxieties, which existed not only
on account of the increasing cost, but also on the
score of the continually growing bulk of mail-matter,
piled up to mountainous heights on the
roof, instead of, as originally, being easily stowed
away in the depths of the hind boot. It was
considered a great advantage of the mail-coaches
built by Waude in these last days that they were
not only built with a low centre of gravity, but
that, with a dropped hind axle, they made a
deeper and more capacious boot possible, in which
were stowed the more valuable portions of the
mail. Had railways not at the very cynthia of
the moment come to supply a “felt want,” certainly
the mails must on many roads have been
carried by mail-vans devoted exclusively to the
service. But in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway carried mailbags, and in anticipation
of the opening throughout of the London
and Birmingham, the first long route, in September
1838, an Act of Parliament was passed on
August 14th in that year, authorising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
conveyance of mails by railways. We must not,
however, suppose that such instant advantage was
always taken of new methods. That would not
be according to the traditions of the Post Office.
Accordingly, we find that, although what is now
the London and South-Western Railway was
opened between Nine Elms and Portsmouth in
May 1840, it was not until 1842 that the Portsmouth
Mail went by rail. For two years it
continued to perform the 73 miles 3 furlongs in
9 hours 10 minutes, when it might have gone
by train in 6 hours 10 minutes less.</p>

<p>With these changes, London lost an annual
spectacle of considerable interest. From 1791
the procession of the mail-coaches on the King’s
birthday had been the grand show occasion of the
Post Office year. No efforts and no expense were
spared by the loyal contractors (loyal in spite of the
ofttimes arbitrary dealings of the Post Office with
them) to grace the day; and Vidler and Parratt,
who for many years had the monopoly of supplying
the coaches, equalled them in the zeal
displayed. The coaches were drawn up at twelve,
noon, to the whole number of twenty-seven, at the
factory on Millbank, beautiful in new paint and
new gilding; the Bristol Mail, as the senior, leading,
the others in the like order of their establishment.
On this occasion the Post Office provided
each guard with a new gold-laced hat and scarlet
coat, and the mail-contractors who horsed the
coaches, not to be outdone, found scarlet coats
for their coachmen, in addition to providing new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
harness. The coachmen and guards, unwilling
to be beaten in this loyal competition, provided
themselves with huge nosegays, as big as cauliflowers.
When, as in the reign of William IV.,
the King’s birthday fell in a pleasant time
of the year, the procession of the mails was
a beautiful and popular sight, attracting not
only the general public, but the very numerous
sporting folks, who welcomed the opportunity of
seeing at their best, and all together, the one
hundred and two noble horses that drew the
mails from the Metropolis to all parts of the
kingdom. Everything, indeed, was very special
to the occasion. Each coach was provided with
a gorgeous hammer-cloth, a species of upholstery
certainly not in use on ordinary journeys. No one
was allowed on the roof, but the coachman and
guard had the privilege of two tickets each for
friends for the inside. Great, as may be supposed,
was the competition for these. For the contractors
themselves there was the cold collation
provided by Vidler and Parratt at Millbank, at
three o’clock, when the procession was over.</p>

<div id="ip_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.6875em;">

  <div class="caption vtight"><p><span class="in2">THE BRISTOL MAIL AT HYDE PARK CORNER, 1838.</span>
<span class="fright"><i>After J. Doyle.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The route varied somewhat with the circumstances
of the time, always including the residence
of the Postmaster-General for the time being.
Punctually at noon it started off, headed by a
horseman, and with another horseman between
each coach. Nearing St. James’s Palace, it was
generally reduced to a snail’s pace, for the crowd
always assembled densely there, on the chance
of seeing the King; and the authorities of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19<br /><a id="Page_20">20</a><br /><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
period were not clever at clearing a route.
Imagine now the front of Carlton House Palace,
or St. James’s, and the Londoners of that age
assembled in their thousands. The procession
with difficulty approaches, and halts. Two barrels
of porter—Barclay &amp; Perkins’ best—are in
position in front of the Royal residence, and to
each coachman and guard is handed a capacious
pewter pot—it is a sight to make a Good Templar
weep. The King and Queen and the Royal
family now appear at an open window, the King
removing his hat and bowing, to a storm of
applause—as though he had done something
really clever or wonderful. Now the coachman
of the Bristol Mail uncovers, and holding high
the shining pewter, exclaims: “We drink to
the health of His Gracious Majesty: God bless
him!” and suiting the action to the words, dips
his nose into the pot, which in an incredibly
short time is completely inverted and emptied.
Fifty-three other voices simultaneously repeat
the same words, and fifty-three pint pots are
in like manner drained in the twinkling of an
eye. The King and his family now retire, and
the procession prepares to move on; but the
mob, moved by loyalty and the sight of the
beer-barrels, grows clamorous: “King, King!
Queen, Queen!” cry a thousand voices; while
a thousand more yell, “Beer, beer!” When at
length the King does return, to bow once more,
he gazes upon two thousand people struggling
for two half-empty barrels, which in the scuffle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
have upset, and speedily become empty. Meanwhile
the coaches have moved off, to complete
their tour to the General Post Office, and thence
back to Millbank.</p>

<p>These processions, from some cause or another
not now easily to be discovered, were omitted in
1829 and 1830. May 17th, 1838, when twenty-five
mails paraded, was the last occasion; for
already the railway was threatening the road,
and when Queen Victoria’s birthday recurred
the ranks of the mails were sadly broken.</p>

<p>This memorable year, 1837, then, was the
last unbroken year of the mail-coaches starting
from London. Since September 23rd, 1829, when
the old General Post Office in Lombard Street was
deserted for the great building in St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
they had come and gone. The first ever
to enter its gates, as the result of keen competition,
had been the up Holyhead Mail of that
date; the last was the Dover Mail, in 1844.</p>

<p>The mail-coaches loaded up about half-past
seven at their respective inns, and then assembled
at the Post Office Yard to receive the bags. All,
that is to say, except seven West of England
mails—the Bath, Bristol, Devonport, Exeter,
Gloucester, Southampton and Stroud—whose
coaches started from Piccadilly, the bags being
conveyed to them at that point by mail-cart.
There were thus twenty-one coaches starting
nightly from the General Post Office precisely at
8 o’clock. Here is a list of the mails setting out
every night throughout the year:—</p>

With the exception of the Brighton, Portsmouth,
Dover and Hastings, they were all
splendidly-appointed four-horse coaches; but those
four places being only at short distances, speed
was unnecessary, and they were only provided
with pair-horse mails. Had a speed similar
to that maintained on most other mails been
kept up, letters and passengers would have
reached the coast in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The so-called “Yarmouth Mail” was, we are
told by those who travelled on it, an ordinary
stage-coach, carrying the usual four inside and
twelve outside, chartered by the Post Office to
carry the mail-bags; but the old print, engraved
here, does not bear out that contention.</p>

<p>The <em>arrival</em> of the mails in London was an early
morning affair. First of all came the Leeds, at
five minutes past four, followed at an interval of
over an hour—5.15—by the Glasgow, and then, at
5.39, by the Edinburgh. All arrived by 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>There was then, as now, no Sunday delivery
of letters in London, and Saturday nights were,
by consequence, saturnalias for the up-mails.
Although the clock might have been set with
accuracy by their passing at any other time, their
coming into London on Sundays was a happy-go-lucky,
chance affair. The coachmen would
arrange to meet on the Saturday nights at such
junctions of the different routes as Andover,
Hounslow, Puckeridge, and Hockliffe, and so
in company have what they very descriptively
termed a “roaring time.”</p>

In 1836 the fastest mail ran on a provincial
route. This was the short 28-miles service
between Liverpool and Preston, maintained at
10 miles 5 furlongs an hour. The slowest was
the 19-miles Canterbury and Deal, at 6 miles
an hour, including stops for changing. The
average speed of all the mails was as low as
8 miles 7 furlongs an hour.</p>

<p>In 1838 there were 59 four-horse mails in
England and Wales, 16 in Scotland, and 29 in
Ireland, in addition to a total number of 70
pair-horse: some 180 mails in all. It was in
this year that—the novelty of railways creating
a desire for fast travelling—the Post Office
yielded to the cry for speed, and, abandoning
the usual conservative attitude, went too far
in the other direction, overstepping the bounds
of common safety. For some time the mails
between Glasgow and Carlisle, and Carlisle
and Edinburgh were run to clear 11 miles an
hour, which meant an average pace of 13
miles an hour. These were popularly called
the “calico mails,” because of their lightness.
The time allowed between Carlisle and Glasgow,
96 miles, was 8 hours 32 minutes, and it was
a sight to see it come down Stanwix Brow
on a summer evening. It met, however, with
so many accidents that cautious folk always
avoided it, preferring the orthodox 10 miles an
hour—especially by lamplight in the rugged
Cheviots. Even at that pace there had been
more than enough risk, as these incidents from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Post Office records of three years earlier
clearly show:—</p>

<p>No place was better served by the Post
Office than Exeter in the last years of the
road, and few so well. Before 1837 it had no
fewer than three mails, and in that year a fourth
was added. All four started simultaneously
from the General Post Office, and reached the
Queen City of the West within a few hours of
one another every day. On its own merits,
Exeter did not deserve or need all these travelling
and postal facilities, and it was only because it
stood at the converging-point of many routes
that it obtained them. Only one mail, indeed,
was dedicated especially to Exeter, and that
was the last-established, the “New Exeter,”
put on the road in 1837. The others continued
to Devonport or to Falmouth, then a port, a
mail-packet and naval station of great prominence,
where the West Indian mails landed,
and whence they were shipped. To the mail-coaches
making for Devonport and Falmouth,
Exeter was, therefore, only an incident.</p>

The “Old Exeter” Mail, continued on to
Falmouth, kept consistently to the main Exeter
Road, through Salisbury, Dorchester and Bridport.
Before 1837 it had performed the journey to
Exeter in 20 hours and to Falmouth in 34¾ hours,
but was then accelerated one hour as between
London and Exeter, and although slightly decelerated
onwards, the gain on the whole distance
was 49 minutes.</p>

<p>Five minutes in advance of this ran the
“Quicksilver” Devonport Mail, as far as Salisbury,
where, until 1837, it branched off, going
by Shaftesbury, Sherborne and Yeovil, a route
5¾ miles shorter than the other. It was 1¾ hours
quicker than the “Old Exeter” as far as that
city. Here is the time-table of the “Quicksilver”
at that period, to Exeter:—</p>

<p>Thus 18 hours 14 minutes were allowed for the
173 miles. In 1837 the “Quicksilver” was put
on the “upper road” by Amesbury and Ilminster,
and her pace again accelerated; this time by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
1 hour 38 minutes to Exeter and 4 hours
39 minutes to Falmouth. This then became the
fastest long-distance mail in the kingdom, maintaining
a speed, including stops, of nearly 10¼
miles an hour between London and Devonport.
It should be remembered, when considering the
subject of speed, that the mails had not only to
change horses and stay for supper and breakfast,
like the stage-coaches, but also had to call at
the post offices to deliver and collect the mailbags,
and all time so expended had to be made
up. The “Quicksilver” must needs have gone
some stages at 12 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Time also had to be kept in all kinds of
weather, and the guard—who was the servant
of the Post Office, and not, as the coachman was,
of the mail-contractors—was bound to see that
time was kept, and had power, whenever it was
being lost, to order out post-horses at the expense
of the contractors. Six, and sometimes eight,
horses were often thus attached to the mails.
The route of the “Quicksilver” from 1837 was

coachman’s duty to be as expeditious as possible, and to report the horsekeepers
if they are not always ready when the coach arrives, and active in
getting it off. The guard is to give his best assistance in changing, whenever
his official duties do not prevent it.</p>

The “New Exeter” Mail went at the moderate
inclusive speed of 9 miles an hour, and reached
Exeter, where it stopped altogether, 1 hour
38 minutes later than the “Quicksilver.” The
fourth of this company went a circuitous route
down the Bath Road to Bath, Bridgewater, and
Taunton, and did not get into Exeter until
3.57 p.m. Halting ten minutes, it went on to
Devonport, and stopped there at 10.5 that night.</p>

<p>The tabulated form given on opposite page
will clearly show how the West of England
mails went in 1837.</p>

<p>The starting of the “Quicksilver” and the
other West-country mails was a recognised London
sight. That of the “Telegraph” would have
been also, only it left Piccadilly at 5.30 in the
morning, when no one was about besides the
unhappy passengers, except the stable-helpers.
Chaplin, who horsed the “Quicksilver” and
other Western mails from town, did not start
them from the General Post Office, but from the
Gloucester Coffee-House, Piccadilly. The mail-bags
were brought from St. Martin’s-le-Grand
in a mail-cart, and the City passengers in an
omnibus. The mails set out from Piccadilly at
8.30 p.m.</p>

<p>It was at Andover that the “Quicksilver,”
from 1837, leaving its contemporary mails,
climbed up past Abbot’s Ann to Park House and
the bleak Wiltshire downs, along a lonely road,
and finally came, up hill, out of Amesbury to
the most exposed part of Salisbury Plain, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Stonehenge, in the early hours of the morning.
The “Quicksilver” was a favourite subject with
the artists of that day, who were never weary
of pictorially representing it. They have shown
it passing Kew Bridge, and the old “Star and
Garter,” on the outward journey, in daylight—presumably
the longest day in the year, because
it did not reach that point until 9 p.m. Two of
them have, separately and individually, shown
us the famous attack by the lioness in 1816; and
two others have pictured it on the up journey,
passing Windsor Castle, and entering the City at
Temple Bar; but no one has ever represented
the “Quicksilver” passing beneath that gaunt
and storm-beaten relic of a prehistoric age, Stonehenge.
One of them, however, did a somewhat
remarkable thing. The picture of the “Quicksilver”
passing within sight of Windsor was
executed and published in 1840, two years after
the gallant old mail had been taken off that
portion of the road, to be conveyed by railway.
Perhaps the print was, so to speak, a post-mortem
one, intended to keep the memory of the old
days fresh in the recollection of travellers by
the mail.</p>

<p>The London and Southampton Railway was
opened to Woking May 23rd, 1838, and to Winchfield
September 24th following, and by so much
the travels of the “Quicksilver” and the other
West-country coaches were shortened. For some
months they all resorted to that station, and then
to Basingstoke, when the line was opened so far.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37<br /><a id="Page_38">38</a><br /><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
June 10th, 1839. This shortening of the coach
route was accompanied by the following advertisement
in the <cite>Times</cite> during October 1838, the
forerunner of many others:—</p>

<p>“Bagshot, Surrey—49 Horses and harness.
To Coach Proprietors, Mail Contractors, Post
Masters, and Others.—To be Sold by Auction,
by Mr. Robinson, on the premises, ‘King’s Arms’
Inn, Bagshot, on Friday, November 2, 1838, at
twelve o’clock precisely, by order of Mr. Scarborough,
in consequence of the coaches going per
Railway.</p>

<p>“About Forty superior, good-sized, strengthy,
short-legged, quick-actioned, fresh horses, and
six sets of four-horse harness, which have been
working the Exeter ‘Telegraph,’ Southampton
and Gosport Fast Coaches, and one stage of the
Devonport Mail. The above genuine Stock
merits the particular Attention of all Persons
requiring known good Horses, which are for
unreserved sale, entirely on Account of the
Coaches being removed from the Road to the
Railway.”</p>

<p>In Thomas Sopwith’s diary we find this significant
passage: “On the 11th May, 1840, the
coaches discontinued running between York and
London, although the railways were circuitous.”
Thus the glories of the Great North Road began
to fade, but it was not until 1842 that the Edinburgh
Mail was taken off the road between
London, York, and Newcastle. July 5th, 1847,
witnessed the last journey of the mail on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
storied road, in the departure of the coach from
Newcastle-on-Tyne for Edinburgh. The next day
the North British Railway was opened.</p>

<p>The local Derby and Manchester Mail was
one of the last to go. It went off in October
1858. But away up in the far north of Scotland,
where Nature at her wildest, and civilisation and
population at their sparsest, placed physical and
financial obstacles before the railway engineers,
it was not until August 1st, 1874, that the mail-coach
era closed, in the last journey of the mail-coach
between Wick and Thurso. That same day
the Highland Railway was opened, and in the
whole length and breadth of England and Scotland
mail-coaches had ceased to exist.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After Charles Hunt, 1840.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The mail-coaches in their prime were noble
vehicles. Disdaining any display of gilt lettering
or varied colour commonly to be seen on the competitive
stage-coaches, they were yet remarkably
striking. The lower part of the body has been
variously described as chocolate, maroon, and
scarlet. Maroon certainly was the colour of the
later mails, and “chocolate” is obviously an error
on the part of some writer whose colour-sense was
not particularly exact; but we can only reconcile
the “scarlet” and “maroon” by supposing that
the earlier colouring was in fact the more vivid
of the two. The fore and hind boots were black,
together with the upper quarters of the body,
and were saved from being too sombre by the
Royal cipher in gold on the fore boot, the number
of the mail on the hind, and, emblazoned on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41<br /><a id="Page_42">42</a><br /><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
upper quarters, four devices eloquent of the majesty
of the united kingdoms and their knightly orders.
There shone the cross of St. George, with its
encircling garter and the proud motto, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Honi soit
qui mal y pense</i>”; the Scotch thistle, with the
warning “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nemo me impune lacessit</i>”; the shamrock
and an attendant star, with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quis
separabit?</i> query (not yet resolved); and three
Royal crowns, with the legend of the Bath,
“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tria juncta in uno</i>.” The Royal arms were
emblazoned on the door-panels, and old prints
show that occasionally the four under quarters
had devices somewhat similar to those above.
The name of each particular mail appeared in
unobtrusive gold letters. The under-carriage and
wheels were scarlet, or “Post Office red,” and the
harness, with the exception of the Royal cypher
and the coach-bars on the blinkers, was perfectly
plain.</p>

<p>One at least of the mail-coaches still survives.
This is a London and York mail, built
by Waude, of the Old Kent Road, in 1830, and
now a relic of the days of yore treasured by
Messrs. Holland &amp; Holland, of Oxford Street.
Since being run off the road as a mail, it has
had a curiously varied history. In 1875 and the
following season, when the coaching revival was
in full vigour, it appeared on the Dorking Road,
and so won the affections of Captain “Billy”
Cooper, whose hobby that route then was, that
he had an exact copy built. In the summer of
1877 it was running between Stratford-on-Avon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and Leamington. In 1879 Mr. Charles A. R.
Hoare, the banker, had it at Tunbridge Wells,
and also ordered a copy. Since then the old
mail-coach has been in retirement, emerging now
and again as the “Old Times” coach, to emphasise
the trophies of improvement and progress
in the Lord Mayor’s Shows of 1896, 1899 and
1901, in the wake of electric and petrol motor-cars,
driven and occupied by coachmen and
passengers dressed to resemble our ancestors of
a hundred years ago.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>MAIL-COACH BUILT BY WAUDE, 1830.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>Now in possession of Messrs. Holland &amp; Holland.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The coach is substantially and in general lines
as built in 1830. The wheels have been renewed,
the hind boot has a door inserted at the back,
and the interior has been relined; but otherwise
it is the coach that ran when William IV. was
king. It is a characteristic Waude coach, low-hung,
and built with straight sides, instead of
the bowed-out type common to the products
of Vidler’s factory. It wears, in consequence, a
more elegant appearance than most coaches of
that time; but it must be confessed that what
it gained in the eyes of passers-by it must have
lost in the estimation of the insides, for the
interior is not a little cramped by those straight
sides. The guard’s seat on the “dickey”—or
what in earlier times was more generally known
as the “backgammon-board”—remains, but his
sheepskin or tiger-skin covering, to protect his
legs from the cold, is gone. The trapdoor into
the hind boot can be seen. Through this the
mails were thrust, and the guard sat throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45<br /><a id="Page_46">46</a><br /><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the journey with his feet on it. Immediately
in front of him were the spare bars, while above,
in the still-remaining case, reposed the indispensable
blunderbuss. The original lamps, in their
reversible cases, remain. There were four of
them—one on either fore quarter, and one on
either side of the fore boot, while a smaller one
hung from beneath the footboard, just above the
wheelers. The guard had a small hand-lamp of
his own to aid him in sorting his small parcels.
The door-panels have apparently been repainted
since the old days, for, although they still
keep the maroon colour characteristic of the
mail-coaches, the Royal arms are gone, and in
their stead appears the script monogram, in
gold, “V.R.”</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1773, the Reverend James Murray, Minister of
the High Bridge Meeting House at Newcastle,
published a little book which he was pleased to
call <i>The Travels of the Imagination; or, a True
Journey from Newcastle to London</i>, purporting to
be an account of an actual trip taken in 1772.
I do not know how his congregation received
this performance, but the inspiration of it was
very evidently drawn from Sterne’s <i>Sentimental
Journey</i>, then in the heyday of its success and
singularly provocative of imitations—all of them
extraordinarily thin and poor. Sentimental
travellers, without a scintilla of the wit that
jewelled Sterne’s pages, gushed and reflected in
a variety of travels, and became a public nuisance.
Surely no one then read their mawkish products,
any more than they do now.</p>

<p>Murray’s book was, then, obviously, to any one
who now dips into it, as trite and jejune as the
rest of them; but it has now, unlike its fellows,
an interesting aspect, for the reason that he gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
details of road-travelling life which, once commonplace
enough, afford to ourselves not a little entertainment.
Equally entertaining, too, and full of
unconscious humour, are those would-be eloquent
rhapsodies of his which could only then have
rendered him an unmitigated bore. It should
be noted here that although his picture of road-life
is in general reliable enough, we must by no
means take him at his word when he says he
journeyed all the way from Newcastle to London.
We cannot believe in a traveller making that
claim who devotes many pages to the first fifteen
miles between Newcastle and Durham, and yet
between Durham and Grantham, a distance of a
hundred and fifty miles, not only finds nothing of
interest, but fails to tell us whether he went by the
Boroughbridge or the York route, and mentions
nothing of the coach halting for the night between
the beginning of the journey at Newcastle, and
the first specified night’s halt at Grantham, a
hundred and sixty-five miles away. Those were
the times when the coaches inned every night,
and not until the “Wonder” London and
Shrewsbury Coach was started, in 1825, did any
coach ever succeed in doing much more than a
hundred miles a day. So much in adverse
criticism. But while a very casual glance is
sufficient to expose his pretensions of having made
the entire journey in this manner, it is equally
evident that he knew portions of the road, and
that he was conversant with the manners and
customs that then obtained along it—as no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
then could help being. The fare between Newcastle
and London, the lengthy halts on the way,
and the manner in which the passengers often
passed the long evenings at the towns where they
rested for the night—witnessing any theatrical
performance that offered—are extremely interesting,
as also is the curious sidelight thrown
upon the fact that actors—technically, in the
eyes of the law, “rogues and vagabonds”—were
then actually so regarded. How poorly considered
the theatrical profession then was, is, of course,
well known; but it is curious thus to come upon
a reference to the fact that London theatres then
had long summer vacations, in which the actors
and actresses must starve if they could not
manage to pick up a meagre livelihood by barnstorming
in the country; as here we see them
doing.</p>

<p>So much by way of preface. Now let us see
what our author has to say.</p>

<p>To begin with, he, like many another before
and since, found it disagreeable to be wakened in
the morning. When a person is enjoying sweet
repose in his bed, to be suddenly awakened by the
rude, blustering voice of a vociferous ostler was
distinctly annoying. More annoying still, however,
to lose the coach; and so there was no help for
it, provided the stage was to be caught. The
morning was very fine when the passengers,
thus untimely roused, entered the coach. Nature
smiled around them, who only yawned in her face
in return. Pity, thought our author, that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
not to ride on horseback: they could then enjoy
the pleasures of the morning, snuff the perfumes
of the fields, hear the music of the grove and
the concert of the wood.</p>

<p>These reflections were cut short by the crossing
of the Tyne by ferry. The bridge had fallen on
November 17th, 1771, and the temporary ferry
established from the Swirl, Sandgate, to the
south shore was the source of much inconvenience
and delay. The coach was put across on a raft
or barge, but in directing operations to that end,
the ferryman was not to be hurried. One had to
wait the pleasure of that arbitrary little Bashaw,
who would not move beyond the rule of his
own authority, or mitigate the sentence of those
who were condemned to travel in a stage-coach
within a ferry-boat.</p>

<p>Our author, as he hated every idea of slavery
and oppression, was not a little offended at the
expressions of authority used on this occasion by
the august legislator of the ferry. The passengers
were now in the barge, and obliged to sit quiet
until this tyrant gave orders for departure. The
vehicle for carrying coach and passengers across
the river was the most tiresome and heavy that
ever was invented. Four rowers in a small boat
dragged the ponderous ferry across the river,
very slowly and with great exertions, and almost an
hour was consumed in thus breasting the yellow
current of the broad and swiftly-running Tyne.
Meanwhile, there was plenty of time to reflect on
what might happen on the passage, and abundant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
opportunity for putting up a few ejaculations to
Heaven to preserve them all from the dangers of
ferryboats and tyrants.</p>

<p>But the voyage at last came to an end. So
soon as they were landed on the south side of the
river Tyne, they were saluted by a blackbird, who
welcomed them to the county of Durham. It
seemed to take pleasure in seeing them fairly out
of the domains of Charon, and whistled cheerfully
on their arrival. “Nature,” said Mr. James
Murray to himself, “is the mistress of real
pleasure: this same blackbird cannot suffer us to
pass by without contributing to our happiness.
Liberty (he continued) seems to be the first principle
of music. Slaves can never sing from the
heart.”</p>

<p>No: they sing, like everyone else, from the
throat.</p>

<p>But these observations carried them beyond
Gateshead and to the ascent of the Fell, along
whose steep sides the pleasures of the morning
increased upon them. The whins and briars sent
forth a fragrance exceedingly delightful, and on
every side of the coach peerless drops of dew hung
dangling upon the blossoms of the thorns, adding
to the perfume. Aurora now began to streak
the western sky—something wrong with the solar
system that morning, for the sun commonly rises
in the east—and the spangled heavens announced
the advent of the King of Day. Sol at last
appeared, and spread his healthful beams over
the hills and valleys, and the wild beasts now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
retired to their dens, and those timorous animals
that go abroad in the night to seek their food were
also withdrawn to the thickets. The hares, as
an exception—and yet this was not the lunatic
month of March—were skipping across the lawns,
tasting the dewy glade for their morning’s repast.
The skylark was skylarking—or, rather, was
already mounted on high, serenading his dame
with mirthful glee and pleasure. (Here follow
two pages of moral reflections on skylarks and
fashionable debauchees, with conclusions in favour
of the larks, and severe condemnation of “libidinous
children of licentiousness,” who are bidden “go
to the lark, ye slaves of pollution, and be wise.
<em>He</em> does not stroll through the grove or thicket to
search for some new amour, but keeps strictly to
the ties of conjugal affection, and cherishes the
partner of his natural concerns.”)</p>

<p>In the midst of these idyllic contemplations,
a grave and solemn scene opened to the view.
Hazlett, who had robbed the mail in 1770, hung
on a gibbet at the left hand. “Unfortunate and
infatuated Hazlett! Hadst thou robbed the nation
of millions, instead of robbing the mail and
pilfering a few shillings from a testy old maid,
thou hadst not been hanging, a spectacle to
passers-by and a prey to crows. Thy case was
pitiable—but there was no mercy: thou wast
poor, and thy sin unpardonable. Hadst thou
robbed to support the Crown, and murdered for
the Monarchy, thou might’st have been yet alive.”</p>

<p>The place where Hazlett hung, the writer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
considered to be the finest place in the world for
a ghost-walk. “At the foot of a wild romantic
mountain, near the side of a small lake, are his
remains; his shadow appears in the water and
suggests the idea of two malefactors. The
imagination may easily conjure up his ghost.
Many spirits have been seen in wilds not so fit
for the purpose. This robber is perhaps the
genius of the Fell, and walks in the gloomy
shades of night by the side of this little lake.
This (he adds—it must have been a truly comforting
thought to the other passengers) is all
supposition.” The dreary place was one well
calculated for raising gloomy ideas, tending to
craze the imagination.</p>

<p>After this, it was a relief to reach Durham,
a very picturesquely situated city with a grand
cathedral and bishop’s palace. The pleasant banks
on the west side of the river Wear were adorned
with stately trees, mingled with shrubs of various
kinds, which brought to one’s mind the romantic
ideas of ancient story, when swains and nymphs
sang their loves amongst trees by the side of some
enchanted river. The abbey and the castle
called to mind those enchanted places where
knights-errant were confined for many years,
until delivered by some friend who knew how
to dissolve the chains and charm the necromancy.</p>

<p>Durham, he thought, would be a very fine
place, were it not for the swarms of clergy in
it, who devoured every extensive living without
being of any real service to the public. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
common people in Durham were very ignorant
and great profaners of the Sabbath Day, and,
indeed, over almost the whole of England the
greatest ignorance and vice were under the noses
of the bishops. He would not pretend to give
a reason for this, but the fact was apparent.</p>

<p>Durham was a very healthful place—the soil
dry, the air wholesome; but the Cathedral
dignitaries performed worship rather as a grievous
task than as a matter of choice, a thing not
infrequently to be observed in our own days.
The woman who showed the shrine of St.
Cuthbert did not understand Mr. Murray when
he referred to the Resurrection, a fact that
gave him a good opportunity to enlarge upon
the practically heathenish state of Durham’s
ecclesiastical surroundings.</p>

<p>All this sightseeing, and these reflections and
observations at Durham (and a good many more
from which the reader shall be spared) were
rendered possible by a lengthy halt made by
the coach in that city. Thus there was ample
time for seeing the cathedral—“very noble and
delightful to the eyes of those who had a taste
for antiquity or Gothic magnificence,” he says.</p>

<p>After they were wearied with sauntering in
this old Gothic abbey, they went down to the
river side. There the person who was fond of
rural pleasures might riot at large. Comparisons
drawn on the spot between the choristers of the
grove, who sang from the heart, and the minor
canons and prebendaries of the cathedral, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
wearily performed their duties for a living, were,
naturally, greatly to the disadvantage of the
dignified clergy.</p>

<p>Strolling through the suburb of Old Elvet,
the company at last returned to the inn—the
“New Inn” it was called. The landlord of
this hostelry was a jolly, honest man; his house
spacious, and fit even to serve the Bishop. All
things were cheap, good, and clean at this inn.
If a person came in well pleased, he would find
nothing to offend him, provided he did not create
some offence to himself—which sounds just a
little confused.</p>

<p>While our itinerant chronicler was noting
down all these things, orders were given for
departure, and so he had hurriedly to conclude.</p>

<p>And now, turning from wayside reflections, we
get a description of the passengers. The coach,
when it left Newcastle, was full. Four ladies,
a gentleman of the sword and our humble
servant made up its principal contents. They
sat in silence for some time, until they were jolted
into good humour by the motion of the vehicle,
which opened their several social faculties. One
of their female companions, who was a North
Briton, a jolly, middle-aged matron with abundance
of good sense and humour, entertained
the company for a quarter of an hour with the
history of her travels. She had made the tour of
Europe, and had visited the most remarkable places
in Christendom, in the quality of a dutiful wife,
attending her valetudinary husband, travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
for the recovery of his health. Her easy,
unaffected manner in telling a story made her
exceedingly good company, and none had the
least inclination to interrupt her until she was
pleased to cease. She knew how to time her
discourse, and never, like the generality of her
sex, degenerated into tediousness and insipidity.</p>

<p>At every stage she was a conformist to all
the measures of the company, and went into
every social proposal that was made.</p>

<p>Another companion was a widow lady of
Newcastle, quite as agreeable as the former.
She understood how to make them laugh. Unfortunately,
she only went one stage, and they
then lost the pleasure of her company.</p>

<p>The third passenger was a Newcastle lady,
well known in the literary world for her useful
performances for the benefit of youth. This
female triumvirate would have been much upon
a par had they all been travellers, for their gifts
of conversation were much alike; but the lady
who had taken the tour of Europe possessed in
that the advantage of circumstances.</p>

<p>The fourth lady was the Scottish lady’s
servant. As she said nothing the whole way
(remarks Mr. Murray), I shall say nothing of her.</p>

<p>The fifth person was an officer in the army,
who appeared very drowsy in the morning, and
came forth of his chamber with every appearance
of reluctance. His hair was dishevelled
and quite out of queue, and he seemed to be
as ready for a sleep as if he had not been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
bed. He was, for a time, as dumb as a Quaker
when not moved by the spirit, and by continuing
in silence, at last fell asleep until they had completed
nearly half the first stage. During this
time, Mr. Murray sarcastically observes, he said
no ill.</p>

<p>They finished their first stage without exchanging
many words with this son of Mars,
except some of those flimsy compliments gentlemen
of the sword pay frequently to the ladies.
After a dish of warm tea the tissues of his tongue
were loosed, and he began to let his companions
know that he was an officer in the army, and a
man of some consequence. He seemed to be very
fond of war, and spoke in high terms upon the
usefulness of a standing army. When he had
exhausted his whole fund of military arguments
in favour of slavery and oppression, Mr. Murray
observed to him that a standing army had a bad
appearance in a free country, and put it in the
power of the Crown to enslave the nation—with
the like arguments, continued for an unconscionable
space.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising that the soldier
resented this. The spirit of Mars began to work
within him, and he threatened that if he were
near a Justice of the Peace he would have this
argumentative person fined for hindering him
from getting recruits, adding that he once had
a man fined for persuading others not to enlist
in his Majesty’s service.</p>

<p>To this Mr. Murray rejoined that the officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
certainly had a right to say all the fine things
he could to recommend the service of his master,
but, having done that, he had no more to do;
and that any man had also a right to tell his
friends, whom he saw ready to be seduced into
bondage, that they were born free, and ought to
take care how they gave up their liberty—together
with remarks derogatory of the justice
of courts martial.</p>

<p>Our author did not, however, find this military
hero a bloodthirsty man, for, by his own confession,
he and a brother officer had a few months
before surrendered their purses to a highwayman
between London and Highgate for fear of bloodshed.
This showed that some officers were abundantly
peaceable in time of danger, and discovered
no inclination for taking people’s lives. This
gentleman of sword and pistol, in particular, had
a great many solid reasons why men should not
adventure their lives for a little money. He said
there was no courage in fighting a highwayman,
and no honour to be had in the victory over one;
that soldiers should preserve their lives for the
service of the country in case of war, and not run
the risk of losing them by foolish adventure.</p>

<p>These reasons did not altogether satisfy the
ladies, for one of them observed that robbers were
at war alike with laws and governments, and that
the King’s servants were hired to keep the peace
and to defend the King’s subjects from violence;
that officers in the army were as much obliged by
their office and character to fight robbers as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
were bound to fight the French, or any other
enemy; and that footpads were invaders of the
people’s rights and properties, and ought to be
resisted by men whose profession it was to fight,
and who were well paid for so doing. It was for
money all the officers in the army served the
King and fought his battles, and why should they
not as well fight for money in a stage-coach as
in a castle or a field? She insisted that only one
of them could have been killed by the highwayman,
or perhaps but wounded, and there were
several chances that he might have missed them
both. But, supposing the worst—that one had
been shot—it was only the chance of war, and
the other might have secured the robber, which
would have been of more service to the country
than the life of the officer. In short, she observed,
it had the appearance more of cowardice than
disregard for money, for two officers to surrender
their purses to a single highwayman, who had
nothing but one pistol.</p>

<p>The lady’s reflections were severely felt by
the young swordsman, and produced a solemn
silence in the coach for a quarter of an hour,
during which time some fell asleep, and so continued
until coming to the next inn, where the
horses were changed. There two or three glasses
of port restored the officer’s courage, and he
determined, in case of an attack, to defend every
one from the assaults of all highwaymen whatsoever.
To show the courage that sometimes
animated him, he told the story of how he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
dealt with a starving mob in Dumfries. The
hungry people of that town, not disposed to perish
while food was abundant, and corn held by the
farmers and corn-factors for higher prices, assembled
to protest against such methods; and the
magistrates, who thought the people had a right
to starve, sent for the military to oblige them to
famish discreetly or else be shot. Our hero had
command of the party, where, according to his
own testimony, he performed wonders. The poor
people were shot like woodcocks, and those who
could get away with safety were glad to return
home to wrestle with hunger until Heaven should
think fit to provide for them.</p>

<p>The officer was very liberal in abusing those
whom he called “the mob,” and said they were
ignorant, obstinate and wicked, and added that he
thought it no crime to destroy hundreds of them.</p>

<p>The lady who had already given him a lecture
then began to put him in mind of the footpad
whom he and his brother officer had suffered to
escape with their purses, and asked him how he
would quell a number of highwaymen. Taken off
his guard at the mention of footpads, he stared
out of the window with a sort of wildness, as if
one had been at the coach door.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen worthy of note until the
coach came to Grantham, which place they
reached about seven in the evening. The first
things, remarks Mr. Murray—with all the
air of a profound and interesting discovery—that
travellers saw in approaching large towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
were, generally speaking, the church steeples.
Ordinarily higher than the rest of the buildings,
they were—remarkable to relate—on that account
the more conspicuous. The steeple of Grantham
was pretty high, and saluted one’s eyes at a good
distance before the town was approached. It
seemed to be of the pyramidical kind.</p>

<p>Grantham was a pleasant place, although the
houses were indifferently built. On reaching it,
they wandered through the town before returning
to the inn for supper, when the captain took care
to say some civil things to the landlady’s sister,
who was a very handsome young woman. It was,
however, easy to perceive that she was acquainted
with these civilities, and could distinguish between
truth and falsehood. She made the captain keep
his distance in such a manner as put an entire end
to his compliments. The fineness of her person
and the beauty of her complexion were joined
with a modest severity that protected her from
the rudeness and insults which gentlemen think
themselves entitled to use towards a chambermaid,
the character she acted in.</p>

<p>After supper was done, the coach-party were
informed that some of Mr. Garrick’s servants
were that night to exhibit in an old thatched
house in a corner of the town. They had come
abroad into the country during the summer vacation,
to see if they could find anything to keep
their grinders going until the opening of Drury
Lane Theatre. They were that night to play the
<i>Went Indian</i> and the <i>Jubilee</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
The whole of the passengers went to see the
performance. The actors played their parts
very indifferently, but, after all, not so badly but
that one could, with some trouble, manage to
perceive as much meaning in their actions as to
be able to distinguish between an honest man
and a rogue. Our ingenious and imaginative
Mr. Murray thought it must be dangerous for an
actor to play the rogue often, for fear of his
performance becoming something more than an
imitation. But after all, he says, with the fine
intolerant scorn of the old-time dissenting
minister, the generality of players had little
morality to lose.</p>

<p>It was a very poor theatre—being, indeed,
not a theatre at all, and little better than a
barn. The audience, however, was good, and
well dressed, and the ladies handsome. The
performance was over by eleven o’clock, and the
company dismissed. Mr. Murray concludes his
account of the evening’s entertainment by very
sourly observing that their time and that of the
rest of the audience might have been better
employed than in seeing a few stupid rogues
endeavouring to imitate what some of them
really were.</p>

<p>The coach left Grantham at two o’clock the
next morning; much too early, considering the
short rest the night’s gaiety had left them. But
there was no choice—they were under authority,
and had to obey. That person would be a fool
who, having paid £3 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a seat in a stage-coach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
from Newcastle to London, should consent
to lose it by not rising betimes. The worst of
it was, that here one had to take care of one’s
self, because no one would wait upon him or
return him his money. Observe the passengers,
therefore, all, in the coach by 2 a.m. The company
being seated, the driver went off as fast
as if he would have driven them to Stamford in
the twinkling of an eye. So early was the hour
that we are not surprised to be told that the author
fell asleep by the time they were clear of the
town, and doubtless the others did the same.
It may be remarked here that a very excellent
proof of this being a fictitious journey is found
in there being no mention of the passengers being
turned out of the coach to walk up the steep
Spitalgate Hill—a thing always necessary at
that period of coaching history.</p>

<p>The remainder of this not-inaptly named
<i>Travels of the Imagination</i> is made up chiefly
of a long disquisition upon sleep—itself highly
soporific—which only gives place to remarks
upon the journey when the coach arrives on
Highgate Hill. Coming over that eminence,
they had a peep at London.</p>

<p>“It must be a wonderful holy place,” he
suggests to the other passengers, “there are so
many church steeples to be seen.”</p>

<p>The others, who must have known better, said
nothing.</p>

<p>“Are we there?” he asked when they had
reached Islington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“No, not there yet.”</p>

<p>“Is it a large place: four times as large,
for instance, as Newcastle?”</p>

<p>“Ten times as large.”</p>

<p>“Where are the town walls?”</p>

<p>“There are no walls.”</p>

<p>At last they reached Holborn, and the end
of the journey, where the company dispersed
and our chronicler went to bed.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">We</span> also will make a tour down the road. It
shall not be, in the strictly accurate sense of
the word, a “journey,” for we shall travel continuously
by night as well as day—a thing
quite unknown when that word was first
brought into use, and unknown to coaching
until about 1780, when coaches first began to
go both day and night, instead of inning at sundown
at some convenient hostelry on the road.</p>

<p>It matters little what road we take, but as
Mr. Murray came to town from Newcastle,
we may as well pay a return visit along that
same highway—the Great North Road. He
does not explain how he came through Highgate,
but for our part, the first sixty miles or so go
along the Old North Road, and we do not touch
Highgate at all.</p>

<p>Now, since we are setting out merely for the
purpose of seeing something of what life is like
on a great highway, there is no need to mortify
the flesh by arising early in the blushing hours
of dawn, to the tune of the watchman’s cry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
“five o’clock and a fine morning!” and so we
will e’en, like Christians and Britons able to
call their souls their own, go by the afternoon
coach. Let the “Lord Nelson” in this year
1830 go if it will from the “Saracen’s Head,”
Snow Hill, at half-past six in the morning. For
ourselves, we will wait until a quarter to three
in the afternoon, and take the “Lord Wellington”
from the “Bull and Mouth.” We can do no
better, for the “Lord Wellington” goes the 274
miles in 30 hours, which a simple calculation
resolves into 9 miles an hour, including stops.
The fare to Newcastle is £5 15<i>s.</i> inside, or about
5<i>d.</i> a mile. Outside, it is £3 10<i>s.</i>, or a fraction
over 3<i>d.</i> a mile. As our trip is taken in summer-time,
we will go outside; and so, although a good
deal of the journey will have to be through the
night, we, at least, shall not have the disadvantage
of being stewed during the daytime in
the intolerable atmosphere of the inside of a
stage-coach on a July day. Why, indeed, coach-proprietors
do not themselves observe that in
summer-time the outside is the most desirable
place, and charge accordingly, is not easily understood;
nor, indeed, to be understood at all. That
clever fellow De Quincey notices this, and points
out that, although the roof is generally regarded
by passengers and everyone else connected
with coaching as the attic, and the inside
as the drawing-room, only to be tenanted by
gentlefolk, the inside is really the coal-cellar in
disguise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
We recollect, being old travellers, that the
fares to Newcastle used to be much cheaper.
Time was when they were only four guineas
inside and £2 10<i>s.</i> outside, but prices went up
during the late wars with France, and they have
stayed up ever since. The travelling, however,
is better by some five hours than it was fifteen
years ago.</p>

<p>Here we are at the “Bull and Mouth,” in
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, now newly rebuilt by
Sherman, and named the “Queen’s.” It is a
handsome building of red brick, with Portland
stone dressings, but the old stables are still to
be seen at the side, in Bull-and-Mouth Street.
A strong and penetrating aroma of horses and
straw pervades the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Wonderful building, the new General Post
Office, opened last year, nearly opposite. They
say the Government has got something very like
a white elephant in that vast pile. A great deal
too big for present needs, or, indeed, for any
possible extension of Post Office business. Here’s
the “Lord Wellington.” What’s that the yard-porter
says?—He says “they don’t call it nothin’
but the ‘Vellington’ now.”—Smart, turn-out,
is it not, with its yellow wheels and body to
match? You can tell Sherman’s coaches anywhere
by that colouring. What a d——d
nuisance those boys are, pestering one to buy
things one doesn’t want! No; be off with you,
we don’t want any braces or pocket looking-glasses,
nor the “Life and Portrait of His Late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69<br /><a id="Page_70">70</a><br /><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Majesty,” nor any “Sure Cure for Fleas”—use
it on yourselves, you dirty-looking devils!</p>

<p>Thank goodness! we’re off, and the sooner
we’re out of this traffic and off the stones at
Kingsland Turnpike the better. These paved
streets are so noisy, one can scarcely hear oneself
talk, and the rattling sends a jar up one’s
spine. How London grows! we shall soon see
the houses stretching past Kingsland and swallowing
up the country lanes of Dalston and Stoke
Newington.</p>

<p>Hal-lo! That was a near shave. Confound
those brewers’ drays; Shoreditch is always full
of ’em; might have sent us slap over. Why don’t
you keep your eyes open, fool?</p>

<p>The drayman offers to fight us all, one after
the other, with one hand tied behind his back, for
sixpence a head, money down; but though we
have some of “the Fancy” aboard, the “Wellington”
can’t stop for a mill in the middle of
Shoreditch High Street.</p>

<p>Now at last we’re fairly in the country. If
you look back you’ll be able to see St. Paul’s.
This is Stamford Hill, where the rich City indigo
and East and West India merchants live. Warm
men, all of them. There, ahead of us, on the right,
goes the river Lea: as pretty fishing there as you’d
find even in the famous trout streams of Hampshire.
What a quaint, quiet rural place this is at
Tottenham! And Edmonton, with its tea-gardens;
why, London might be fifty miles away!</p>

<p>Here we are, already at Waltham Cross, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
at our first change. This is something like traveling!
We change horses at the “Falcon” in little
more than two minutes, and so are off again,
on the ten-mile stage to Ware, through the long
narrow street of Cheshunt, past the New River
at Broxbourne, and along the broad thoroughfare
of Hoddesdon. At Ware we change teams at the
“Saracen’s Head,” and four fine strong-limbed
chestnuts are put in, to take us the rather hilly
stage on to Buntingford. At this sleepy little
town they take care to give us as strong a team as
you will find in any coach on any road, for the
way rises steadily for some miles over Royston
Downs. A good thing for the horses that the
stage on to Royston town is not more than seven
miles. “I believe you, sir,” says the coachman;
“vy, I’ve heerd my father say, vot driv’ over this
’ere road thirty year ago, that he vore out many
a good ’orse on this stage; an’ ’e vere a careful
man too, as you might say, and turned out every
blessed one, <em>h</em>inside to <em>h</em>out, to valk up-hill for
two mile, wet or fine; strike me blue if he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“They talk of lowering the road through the
top of Reed Hill, don’t they, coachman?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; they torks, and that’s about all
they does do. Lot o’ good torking does my ’orses.
Vot <em>I</em> vants to know is, v’y does we pay the
turnpikes?”</p>

<p>We change at the “Red Lion,” Royston, and
then come on to the galloping ground that brings
us smartly, along a level road, to Arrington Bridge,
the spelling of whose name is a matter of divergent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
opinions among the compilers of road-books. But
whether called Arrington or Harrington, it is a
pretty, retired spot, with a handsome inn and an
equally handsome row of houses opposite.</p>

<p>“Will you please to alight?” asks the stately
landlady of the “Hardwicke Arms” inn and
posting-house, with perhaps a little too much air
of condescension towards us, as coach-passengers.
We of the stage-coaches—nay, even those of the
mails—occupy only a second place in the consideration
of mine host and hostess of this, one
of the finest inns on the road. Their posting
business brings them some very free-handed customers,
and their position, hard by my lord of
Hardwicke’s grand seat of Wimpole, spoils them
for mere ordinary everyday folks.</p>

<p>However, it is now more than half-past seven
o’clock, and we have had no bite nor sup since
two. Therefore we alight at the landlady’s bidding
and hasten into the inn, to make as good a supper
as possible in the twenty minutes allowed.</p>

<p>Half a crown each, in all conscience, for two
cups of tea, and some bread and butter, cold
ham and eggs! We climb up to our places,
dissatisfied. Soon the quiet spot falls away behind,
as our horses get into their stride; and as we
leave, so does a yellow po’shay dash up, and
convert the apparently sleepy knot of smocked
post-boys and shirt-sleeved ostlers, who have
been lounging about the stable entrance, into
a very alert and wide-awake throng.</p>

<p>Caxton, a busy thoroughfare village, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
great “George” inn does a very large business, is
passed, and soon, along this flattest of flat roads,
that grim relic, Caxton Gibbet, rises dark and
forbidding against the translucent evening sky.
Does the troubled ghost of young Gatward,
gibbeted here eighty years ago for robbing the
mail on this lonely spot, ever revisit the scene,
we wonder?</p>

<p>The wise, inscrutable stars hang trembling in
the sky, and the sickle moon is shining softly,
as, having passed Papworth St. Everard, we drop
gently down through Godmanchester and draw
up in front of the “George” at Huntingdon,
58½ miles from London, at ten o’clock.</p>

<p>We take the opportunity afforded by the
change of filling our pocket-flasks with some rich
brown brandy of the right sort, and invest in some
of those very special veal-and-ham sandwiches for
which good Mrs. Ekin has been famous these
years past. Our coachman “leaves us here,” and
we tip him eighteenpence apiece when he comes
round to inform us of the fact.</p>

<p>The new coachman, after some little conversation
with the outgoing incumbent of the bench,
in which we catch the remark made to the newcomer
that some articles or some persons are
“a pretty fair lot, taking ’em all round”—a
criticism that evidently sizes us up for the
benefit of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrère</i>—climbs into his seat, and
giving us all a comprehensive and impartial glance,
settles himself down comfortably. “All right,
Tom?” he asks the guard over his shoulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
“Yes,” answers that functionary. “Then give
’em their heads, Bill,” he says to the ostler; and
away we go into the moonlit night at a steady
pace.</p>

<p>The box-seat passenger, who very successfully
kept the original coachman in conversation nearly
all the way from London to Huntingdon, does not
seem to quite hit it off with our new whip, who
is inclined to be huffish, or, at the least of it, given
to silence and keeping his own counsel. “Have
a weed, coachman?” he asks, after some ineffectual
attempts to get more than a grunt out
of him. “Don’t mind if I do,” is the ungracious
reply, and he takes the proffered cigar and—puts
it into some pocket somewhere beneath the
voluminous capes of his greatcoat. After this,
silence reigns supreme. For ourselves, we have
chatted throughout the day, and now begin to feel—not
sleepy, but meditative.</p>

<p>The moon now rides in unsullied glory through
the azure sky. We top Alconbury Hill at a few
minutes to twelve, and come to the junction of
the Old North and the Great North Roads.
Everything stands out as clearly as if it were
daylight, but with a certain ghost-like and uncanny
effect. “The obelisk,” as the coachmen
have learned to call the great milestone at the
junction of the roads (it is really a square
pedestal) looks particularly spectral, but is not
the airy nothing it seems—as the coachman on
the Edinburgh Mail discovered, a little while
ago. The guard tells us all about it. The usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
thing. Too much to drink at the hospitable bar
of the “George,” at Huntingdon, and a doubt as
to which of the two milestones he saw, on coming
up the road, was the real one. The guard and
all the outsides were in similar case—it was
Christmas, and men made merry—and so there
was nothing for it but to try their quality. Unfortunately,
he drove into the real stone, and not
its spectral duplicate, conjured up by the effects
of strong liquors. We see the broken railings
and the dismounted stone ball that once capped
the thing as we pass. The local surgeon mended
the resultant broken limbs at the “Wheatsheaf,”
whose lighted windows fall into our wake as we
commence the descent of Stonegate Hill.</p>

<p>Stilton. By this time we are too drowsy to
note whether we changed at the “Bell” or at
its rival, directly opposite, the “Angel.” At
any rate, nobody asks us if we would not like
a nice real Stilton cheese to take with us, as
they usually do: it is midnight.</p>

<p>We now pass Norman Cross, and come in
another eight miles to Wansford turnpike, where
the gate is closed and the pikeman gone to bed.
“Blow up for the gate,” said the coachman, when
we were drawing near, to the guard, who blew
his horn accordingly; but it does not seem to
have disturbed the dreams of the janitor. “Gate,
gate!” cry the guard and coachman in stentorian
chorus. The guard himself descends, and blows
a furious series of blasts in the doorway, while
the coachman lashes the casement windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<div id="ip_77" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="526" height="349" alt="" />
  <div class="caption vtight"><p><span class="in4">THE TURNPIKE GATE.</span>
<span class="fright"><i>From a contemporary lithograph.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78<br /><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
At last a shuffling and fumbling are heard
within, and the door is opened. The pikeman
has not been to bed after all; he was, and is,
only drunk, and had fallen into a sottish sleep.
He now opens the gate, in the midst of much
disinterested advice from both our officials—the
guard advising him to stick to Old Tom and leave
brandy alone, and the coachman pointing out
that the Mail will be down presently and that
he had better leave the gate open if he does
not wish to present the Postmaster-General with
forty shillings, that being the penalty to which
a pike-keeper is liable who does not leave a clear
passage for His Majesty’s Mails.</p>

<p>We now cross Wansford Bridge, a very long
and narrow stone structure over the river Nene.
Having done so, slowly and with caution,
we know no more: sleep descends insensibly
upon us.</p>

<p>... Immeasurable æons of time pass by.
We are floating with rhythmic wings in the
pure ether of some unterrestrial paradise. Our
gross earthly integument (twelve stone and a
few extra pounds avoirdupois of flesh and blood
and bone) has fallen away. We want nothing to
eat, for ever and ever, and have left everything
gross and unspiritual far, far below us, and ... a
fearful crash! Convulsively, instinctively, our
arms are thrown out, and we awake, tenaciously
grasping one another. What is this that has
brought us down to earth again and made us
unwillingly assume once more that corporeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
hundredweight, or thereabouts, we had left so
gladly behind? Are we overturned?</p>

<p>No; it was nothing: nothing, that is to say,
but the hunchbacked bridge over the river
Welland, that leads from Stamford Baron into
Stamford Town. It is only the customary bump
and lurch, the guard informs us. May all architects
of hunchback bridges be converted from
straight-backed human beings into bowed and
crooked likenesses of their own abominable
creations! We will keep awake, lest another
such rude awaking await us.</p>

<p>With this intent we gaze, wide-eyed, upon
Stamford Town, its noble buildings wrapped
round in midnight quiet, the moon shining
here full upon the mullioned stone windows of
some ancient mansion, there casting impenetrable
black shadows, making dark mysteries of grand
architectural doorways decorated with curious
scutcheons and overhung with heavy pediments,
like beetling eyebrows. Grand churches whose
spires soar away, away far into the sky, astonish
our newly-awakened vision as the coachman carefully
guides the coach through the narrow and
crooked streets, in which the shadows from
cornices and roof-tops lie so black and sharp
that none but he who has driven here before could
surely bring this coach safely through. Once or
twice we have quailed as he has driven straight
at some solid wall, and have breathed again
when it has proved to be only some oblique
monstrous silhouetted image cast athwart the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
way. Fear only leaves us when we are clear
of the town and once more on the unobstructed
road; then only is there leisure for the mind to
dwell upon the beauties of that glorious old
stone-built town. We are thus ruminating when,
between Great Casterton and Stretton, where
we enter Rutlandshire, the glaring lamps of a
swiftly approaching coach lurch forward out of
the long perspective of road, and, with a clatter
of harness and a sharp crunching of wheels, fall
away, as in a vision. The guard, answering someone’s
question, says it is the Leeds “Rockingham,”
due in London at something after ten in
the morning.</p>

<p>The determination to keep awake was heroic,
but without avail. Even the screaming and
grumbling of the skid and the straining of the
wheels down Spitalgate Hill into Grantham did
not suffice to quite waken us. But what that
noise and the jarring of the wheels failed to do, the
stoppage at the “George” at Grantham and the
sudden quiet <em>do</em> succeed in. Our friend the moon
has by now sunk to rest, and a pallid dawn has
come; someone remarks that it is past three
o’clock in the morning, and someone else is
wakened and hauled forth from amid the snoring
insides, whose snores become gasps and gulps, and
then resolve themselves into the yawns and peevish
exclamations of tired men. The person thus
awakened proves to be a passenger who had booked
to Colsterworth, which is a little village we have
now left eight miles behind us. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
asleep, and as Colsterworth is not one of our stopping
or changing places, the guard forgot all about
him until the change at Grantham. The passenger
and the guard are now waging a furious war of
words on the resounding pavements of the sleeping
town. It seems that the unfortunate inside,
besides being himself carried so far beyond his
destination, has a heavy portmanteau in the like
predicament. If he had been a little bigger and
the guard a little smaller, his fury would perhaps
make him fall upon that official and personally
chastise him. As it is, he resorts to abuse.
Windows of surrounding houses now begin to be
thrown up, and nightcapped heads to inquire
“what the d——l’s the matter, and if it can’t be
settled somewhere else or at some more convenient
season?” The guard says “This ’ere gent wot’s
abusing of me like a blooming pickpocket goes to
sleep and gets kerried past where he wants to get
out, and when I pulls him out, ’stead of taking ’im
him on to Newark or York, ’e——” “Shut up,”
exclaims a fierce voice from above: “can’t a man
get a wink of sleep for you fellows?”</p>

<p>So, the change being put to, the altercation is
concluded in undertones, and we roll off; the irate
passenger to bed at the “George,” vowing he will
get a legal remedy against the proprietors of the
“Wellington” for the unheard-of outrage.</p>

<p>At Newark, a hundred and twenty-five miles
of our journey performed, it is broad daylight as
the coach rolls, making the echoes resound, into
the great market-square. Clock-faces—a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
blanched and debauched-looking to our fancy—proclaim
the hour to be 5.30 a.m. The change
is waiting for us in front of the “Saracen’s Head,”
and so is our new coachman. The old one leaves
us, but before doing so “kicks us”—as the expressive
phraseology of the road has it—for the
usual fees. He has been, so far as we remember
him, a dour, silent, unsociable man, but we think
that, perhaps, as we have been asleep during
the best part of his reign on the box-seat, any
qualities he may possess have not had their due
opportunity, and so he gets two shillings from
ourselves. A passenger behind us gives him a
shilling, which he promptly spits on and turns,
“for luck” as he says, and “in ’opes it’ll grow.”
The passenger who gave it him says, thereupon—in
a broad Scots accent—that he is “an impudent
fellow, and desairves to get nothing at all;” to
which the jarvey rejoins that he has in his time
brought many a Scotchman from Scotland, but,
“this is the fust time, blow me, that <em>h</em>ever I see
one agoin’ back!”—which is a very dark and
mysterious saying. What did he mean?</p>

<p>Our new coachman is a complete change from
our late Jehu. He is a spruce, cheerful fellow,
neat and well brushed, youthful and prepossessing.
“Good morning, gentlemen,” he says cheerily:
“another fine day.” We had not noticed it. All
we had observed was of each other, and that as
every other looked pale, wearied and heavy-eyed,
so we rightly judged must be our own condition.</p>

<p>“Chk!” says our youthful charioteer to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
horses, and away they bound. Newark market-square
glides by, and we are crossing the Trent,
over a long bridge. “Newark Castle, gentlemen,”
says our coachman, jerking his whip to the left
hand; and there we see, rising from the banks of
the broad river, the crumbling, time-stained towers
of a ruined mediæval fortress. Much he has to
say of it, for he is intelligent beyond the ordinary
run. A good and graceful whip, too—one of the
new school: much persuasion and little punishment
for the horses, who certainly seem to put
forward their best paces at his merest suggestion.
It is a good, flat, and fairly straight road, this
ten-mile stage to Scarthing Moor. We cross the
Trent again, then a low-lying tract of water-meadows,
where the night mists still cling in
ghost-like wisps to the grass, and then several
small villages. “This”—says our coachman,
pointing to a church beside the road, and down
the street of one of these little villages—“this is
where Oliver Cromwell came from.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of it?” we ask, knowing
that, whatever its name, the Protector came from
quite a different place.</p>

<p>“Cromwell,” he says.</p>

<p>So this was probably the original seat of that
family many centuries before Oliver came into
the world, which has since then been so greatly
exercised about him.</p>

<p>“Blow up for the change,” says the coachman
to the guard, as, having passed through
Carlton-on-Trent, Sutton-on-Trent, and round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
awkward bend of the road at Weston, we approach
Scarthing Moor and the “Black Bull.” “They’re
a sleepy lot at the ‘Bull,’” he says, in explanation.
The guard produces the “yard of tin” from the
horn-basket, and sounds a melodious tantara: quite
unnecessarily, after all, it seems, for, quite a
distance off, the ostler, dressed after his kind
in trousers and shirt only, with braces dangling
about him, is seen standing in the road, with
the change ready and waiting.</p>

<p>“Got up before you found yourself, this
morning?” asks the coachman.</p>

<p>The ostler says he don’t take no sauce from
no boys what ain’t been breeched above a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>“All right, Sam,” replies the coachman; “your
’art’s all right, if you <em>have</em> got a ’ed full of
wool. Shouldn’t wonder if you don’t make up for
this mistake of yourn by sleepin’ it out for a
month of Sundays after this. If so be you do,
jest hang the keys of the stable outside, and when
we come down agen, Jim and me ’ll put ’em in
ourselves, won’t we, Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim says they will, and will petition Guv’ment
to pension him off, and retire him to the “R’yal
’Orsepital for Towheads.”</p>

<p>Evidently some ancient feud between the
ostler and the coach is in progress, and still far
from being settled. The ostler sulkily watches
us out of sight, as we make our next stage to
Retford. The clocks in the market-place of that
busy little town mark half-past seven, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
“White Hart,” where we drop a passenger for
the Gainsborough coach and another for Chesterfield,
and take up another for York, is a busy
scene. Appetising aromas of early breakfasts being
prepared put a keener edge upon our already
sharpened appetites, and we all devoutly wish we
were at Doncaster, where <em>our</em> breakfast awaits the
coming of the coach. Across Barnby Moor, past
the great “Bell” inn, we take our way, and come
to one more change, at the “Crown,” Bawtry;
then hie away for Doncaster, which we reach,
past Rossington Bridge and the famous St. Leger
course, at half-past nine o’clock.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes for breakfast, gentlemen,”
announces the coachman as we pull up in front of
the “New Angel” inn; while the guard, who has
come with us all the way from London, now
announces that he goes no farther. We give him
half a crown, and hasten, as well as stiffened limbs
allow, down the ladder placed for us outsides to
alight by, to the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>We catch a glimpse of ourselves in a mirror
as we enter. Heavens! is it possible an all-night
journey can make so great a difference in a man’s
personal appearance? While here is a lady who
has been an inside passenger all the way from
town, and yet looks as fresh and blooming as
though she had but just dressed for a walk. How
do they manage it, those delicate creatures?</p>

<p>Our friend, who says he is starving, refuses
to discuss this question. He remarks, with eye
wildly roving o’er the well-laden table-cloth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
that something to eat and drink is more to the
point. We cannot gainsay the contention, and do
not attempt it, but sink into a chair.</p>

<p>“Coffee, sir; tea, sir; ’ot roll; ’am and heggs.
Yorkshire brawn, tongue,” suggests the waiter,
swiftly.</p>

<p>We select something and fall-to. After all,
it is worth while to take a long coach journey,
even if it be only for the appetite it gives one.
Here we are, all of us, eating and drinking as
though we had taken no meals for a week past.
Yes, another cup of coffee, please, and I’ll thank
you to pass the——</p>

<p>“Time’s up, gents; coach just agoin’ to start!”</p>

<p>“Oh! here, I say, you know. We’ve only just
sat down.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got more’n ’nother couple o’ minutes,”
says the new guard; and so, appetite not fully
satisfied, we all troop out and resume our places.</p>

<p>Our coach goes the hilly route, by Ferrybridge
and Tadcaster, to York. We change on the short
stage out of Doncaster, at Robin Hood’s Well,
where the rival inns, the “New” and the
“Robin Hood,” occupy opposite sides of the road;
and again at Ferrybridge, at the “Swan,” where
our smart coachman resigns his seat to an enormously
fat man, weighing nearly, if not quite,
twenty stone. He is so unwieldy that quite a
number of the “Swan” postboys gather round
him, and by dint of much sustained effort, do at
last succeed in pulling and pushing him into his
place, resembling in so doing the Liliputians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
manipulating Gulliver; the coachman himself,
breathing like a grampus, encouraging them by
calling out, “That’s it, lads; another heave like
t’last does it. All together again, and I’ll mak’
it a gallon!”</p>

<p>Across the river Aire to Brotherton, and thence
through Sherburn to Tadcaster, where, having
changed at the “White Horse,” we come along
a level stage into York; the new guard, who
rejoices in the possession of a key-bugle and a
good ear for music, signalising our entrance by
playing, in excellent style, “The Days when we
went Gipsying, a Long Time Ago.”</p>

<p>The coach dines at York. The “Black Swan,”
to which we come, is a house historic in the annals
of coaching, for it was from its door that the
original York and London stage set forth; but
it is a very plain and heavy building. Half an
hour is allowed for dining, and, unlike the
majority of houses down the road, the table-cloth
and the knives and forks and glasses are <em>not</em> the
only things in readiness.</p>

<p>“What have you got, waiter?”</p>

<p>“Hot roast beef, sir, just coming in; very
prime.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any cold chicken for a lady
here?”</p>

<p>“Yessir; cold chicken on the table, sir; in
front of you, sir.”</p>

<p>“You call <em>that</em> chicken, waiter! why, it’s only
a skeleton. Take it away and give it to the dog
in the yard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
“Very sorry, sir; ‘Royal Sovereigns’ very
hungry to-day; very good appetites they had,
sir; wonder they left even the bones.”</p>

<p>“You’re laughing at me, you rascal; bring
another chicken!”</p>

<p>“No more chickens, sir; roast lamb, would
the lady like? hot or cold; green peas, new
potatoes?” ...</p>

<p>“Your apple tart, sir. Ale, sir. Claret,
ma’am.” ...</p>

<p>Dinner disposed of, the coach is ready, but
one of our passengers is missing. Has any one
seen him? He went off, it seems, to see the
cathedral, instead of having dinner. Fortunately
for himself he comes hurrying up just as we are
starting, and the guard hauls him up to his outside
place by main force.</p>

<p>“Tip us a tune,” says the coachman to the
guard, who, rendered sentimental by the steak and
the bottle of stout he had for dinner in the bar,
in company with the buxom barmaid, responds
with “Believe me, if all those Endearing Young
Charms,” as we pass the frowning portal of
Bootham Bar and bump along the very rough
street of Clifton, York’s modern suburb.</p>

<p>This is a thirteen-and-a-half mile stage from
York to Easingwold; but although long, it is an
easy one for the horses, if the coachman does not
demand pace of them, on account of the dead level
of the road. He very wisely lets them take their
own speed, only now and then shaking the reins
when they seem inclined to slacken from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
steady trot. It is a lonely stretch of country,
treeless, flat, melancholy; and the appearance
of Easingwold is welcomed. At the “Rose and
Crown” the new team is put in, and off we go
again, the ten miles to Thirsk. At Northallerton
the horses are changed for a fresh team at the
“Golden Lion,” and the fat coachman, assisted
down with almost as much trouble as he was
hoisted up, resigns the ribbons into the hands of
another.</p>

<p>The usual knot of sightseers of the little town
are gathered about the inn to witness the one
event of the day, the arrival of the London coach.
Among them one perceives the coachman out of
a place; a beggar out at elbows; three recruits
with ribbons in their hats, not quite recovered
from last night’s drink, and stupidly wondering
how the ribbons got there; the “coachman wot
is to take the next stage”; several errand boys
wasting their masters’ time; and a horsey youth
with small fortune but large expectations, who
is the idler of the place—the local man about
town. There is absolutely nothing else for the
inhabitants of Northallerton to do for amusement
but to watch the coaches, the post-chaises and
the chariots as they pass along the one long and
empty street.</p>

<p>Our box-seat passenger leaves us here. Although
he has, all the way down, shown himself
anxious to be intimate with the successive coachmen,
and has paid pretty heavily for the privilege
of occupying that seat of honour, it has been of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
no sporting advantage to him, for he is only a
Cockney tradesman, who has never even driven
a trap, let alone four-in-hand. So when each
whip in turn asked him the questions, conventional
among whips, “whether he had his
driving-gloves on, and would like to take the
ribbons for the next few miles,” he evaded the
offer by “not being in form,” or not knowing
the road, or something else equally annoying to
the coachman, who, in not having an amateur of
driving on the box, thereby missed the canonical
tip of anything from seven shillings to half a
sovereign which the handling of the reins for
twenty miles or so was worth to the ordinary
sportsman.</p>

<p>Our new coachman, on our starting from
Northallerton, keeps the seat beside him vacant.
He says he has a passenger for it down the road.
Tom Layfield, for that is the name of our present
charioteer, works the “Wellington” up and down
between this and Newcastle on alternate days,
Ralph Soulsby being the coachman on the other.
Tom Layfield is a very prim-looking, tall and
spare man, tutor in coachmanship to many gentlemen
on these last fifty-five miles; and it does not
surprise some of us when, passing Great Smeaton,
we are hailed by a very “down the road” looking
young man, whose hat is cocked at a knowing
angle, and whose entire get-up, from the gigantic
mother-o’-pearl buttons on his light overcoat to
the big scarf-pin in the semblance of a galloping
coach and horses, proclaims “amateur coachman.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
It is the young squire of Hornby Grange, on
the right hand, we are told, who is anxious
to graduate in coaching honours, and to be
mentioned in the pages of the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>
by Nimrod, in company with Sir St. Vincent
Cotton, the Brackenburys, and other distinguished
ornaments of the bench.</p>

<p>“‘Afternoon, squire,” says Layfield, as that
young sportsman swings into the seat beside him;
and they talk guardedly about anything and
everything but coaches, until Layfield asks—as
though it had just occurred to him—if he would
not like to “put ’em along” for a few miles.
He accepts, and is just about to take the reins
over when the voice of a hitherto silent gentleman
is heard from behind.</p>

<p>“I earnestly protest, coachman,” he says,
“against your giving the reins into the hands of
that young gentleman, and endangering our lives.
I appeal to the other passengers to support me,”
he continues, glancing round. “We read in the
papers every day of the many serious, and some
fatal, accidents caused by control of the horses
being given to unqualified persons. If you are
well advised, young gentleman, you will relinquish
the reins into their proper keeping; and you,
coachman, ought to know, and do know, that you
would be liable to a fine of any amount from £5
to £10, at the discretion of a magistrate, for
allowing an unauthorised person to drive.”</p>

<p>The coachman takes back the reins, and sulkily
says he didn’t know he had an informer up; to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
which the gentleman rejoins by saying that, so
long as the coachman drives and performs the
duty for which he is paid by his proprietors, he
himself is not concerned to teach him proper
respect; but he cannot refrain from pointing out,
to the coachman in especial, and to the passengers
generally, that it would have been the policy of
an informer to allow the illegal act to be committed
and then to lay an information. He was
really protecting the coachman as well as the
passengers, because it was well known that the
road swarmed with informers, and continued
infractions of the law could not always hope to
go unpunished.</p>

<p>Every one murmurs approval, except the
coachman and his friend, and the guard. The
guard, as an official, is silent; the amateur coachman
has a hot flush upon his face. The coachman,
however, clearly sees himself to be in the wrong,
and awkwardly apologises. Still, we all feel
somewhat constrained, and, passing Croft Spa
and coming to Darlington, experience an ungrateful
relief when the champion of our necks and
limbs leaves us there.</p>

<p>He is no sooner gone than tongues are wagging
about him. “Who is he? What is he? Do you
know him?”</p>

<p>“Talks like a Hact o’ Parlymint,” says the
coachman to his friend.</p>

<p>“And a very good reason, too,” says a man
with knowledge: “he is a Justice of the Peace
and Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Stockton, which holds a higher jurisdiction than
your bench, coachman. I think you’ve had a
very narrow escape of parting with £10 and
costs.”</p>

<p>The guard has a few parcels to take out of
the boot at the “King’s Head,” and a few new
ones to put in, and then we’re off for Rushyford
Bridge, where the coach takes tea, and where we
leave the amateur coachee at the “Wheatsheaf.”</p>

<p>Durham and the coal country open out on
leaving secluded Rushyford. Durham Cathedral,
although itself standing on a height, has the
appearance of being in a profound hollow as the
coach, with the skid on, slowly creaks and groans
down the long hill into the city. Changing at
the “Three Tuns,” the new team toils painfully
up the atrociously steep streets to Framwellgate
Bridge, where the river Wear and the stern
grandeur of the Norman Cathedral, with the bold
rocks and soft woods around it, blend under the
westering sun-rays of a July evening into a lovely
mellowed picture.</p>

<p>Chester-le-Street and Gateshead are ill exchanges
for the picturesqueness of Durham, but
they serve to bring us nearer our journey’s end,
and, truth to tell, we are very weary; so that,
coming down the breakneck streets of Gateshead
in the gathering darkness to the coaly Tyne
and dear dirty Newcastle, with the hum of its
great population and the hooting of its steamers
in our ears, we are filled with a great content.
“Give ’em a tune,” says the coachman; and, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
guard sounding a fanfare, we are quickly over
the old town bridge, along the Side, and at the
Turf Hotel, Collingwood Street. It is nearly ten
o’clock. The journey is done.</p>

<span class="subhead">ACCIDENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the greatest objections urged by the coaching
interest against railways was their danger,
and the certain loss of life on them in case of
accident. It was unfortunate that the opening of
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the
occasion of a fatal mischance that lent emphasis
to the dolorous prophecies of coach-proprietors and
the road interests in general; for on that day
(September 15th, 1830) Mr. Huskisson, a prominent
man in the politics of that time, met his
death by being run over by the first train. It
seems to ourselves incredible, but it was the fact,
that there were those who ascribed this fatality
to the wrath of God against mechanical methods
of travelling. Then first arose that favourite
saying among coachmen, “In a coach accident,
there you are; in a railway accident, where are
you?” The impression thus intended to be conveyed
was that a coaching disaster was a very
trifling affair compared with a railway accident.
But was it? Let us see.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Milton, who in 1810 published
a work on coach-building, lamented the
great number of accidents in his time, and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
that not a tenth part of them was ever recorded
in the newspapers. He darkly added that the
coach-proprietors could probably explain the
reason. However that may be, the following
pages contain a selection of the most tragical
happenings in this sort, culled from the newspapers
of the past. It does by no means pretend
to completeness; for to essay a task of that kind
would be to embark upon a very extensive work,
as well as a very severe indictment of the coaching
age. Moreover, it may shrewdly be suspected
that many drowsy folk fell off the box-seats in
the darkness, and quietly and unostentatiously
broke their necks, without the least notice being
publicly taken. Mere upsets and injuries to
passengers and coachmen are not instanced here.
Only a selection from the fatal accidents has been
made.</p>

<p>1807.—Brighton and Portsmouth coach upset;
coachman killed.</p>

<p>1810.—Rival Brighton and Worthing coaches
racing; one upset; coachman killed.</p>

<p>1819.—“Coburg” (Brighton coach) upset at
Cuckfield, on the up journey. The horses were
fresh, and, dashing away, came into collision with
a waggon. All the eleven outsides were injured.
A Mr. Blake died next day at the “King’s Head,”
Cuckfield, where the injured had been taken.</p>

<p>1826. <i>April.</i>—The Leeds and Wakefield
“True Blue,” going down Belle Hill with horses
galloping, on the wrong side of the road, came
into collision with a coal-cart. The coachman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
skull was fractured, and he died instantly. One
outside passenger’s leg had to be amputated, and
he died the next day. The recovery of another
passenger was regarded as doubtful.</p>

<p>One of the more serious among coach accidents
was that which befell the London and Dorking
stage, in April 1826. It was one of those coaches
that did not carry a guard. It left the “Elephant
and Castle” at nine o’clock in the morning, full
inside and out, and arrived safely at Ewell, where
Joseph Walker, who was both coachman and
proprietor, alighted for the purpose of getting a
parcel from the hind boot. He gave the reins
to a boy who sat on the box, and all would have
been well had it not been for the thoughtless act
of the boy himself, who cracked the whip, and set
the horses off at full speed. They dashed down
the awkwardly curving road by the church and
into a line of wooden railings, which were torn
down for a length of twelve yards. Coming then
to some immovable obstacle, the coach was violently
upset, and the whole of the passengers
hurled from the roof. All were seriously injured,
and one was killed. This unfortunate person was
a woman, who fell upon some spiked iron railings,
“which,” says the contemporary account,
“entered her breast and neck. She was dreadfully
mutilated, none of her features being distinguishable.
She lingered until the following day, when
she expired in the greatest agony.” The gravestone
of this unfortunate person is still to be
seen in the leafy churchyard of Ewell, inscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99<br /><a id="Page_100">100</a><br /><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to the memory of “Catherine, wife of James
Bailey, who, in consequence of the overturning
of the Dorking Coach, April 1826, met with her
death in the 22nd year of her age.”</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After C. B. Newhouse.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>1827. <i>December.</i>—The up Salisbury coach was
driven, in the fog prevailing at the time, into a
pond called the “King’s Water,” at East Bedfont,
on Hounslow Heath. An outside passenger, a
Mr. Lockhart Wainwright, of the Light Dragoons,
was killed on the spot, by falling in the water.
The pond was only two feet deep, but it had
a further depth of two feet of mud, and it
was thought that the unfortunate passenger was
smothered in it. The four women inside the
coach had a narrow escape of being drowned, but
were rescued, and the coach righted, by a crowd
of about a hundred persons, chiefly soldiers from
the neighbouring barracks, who had assembled.</p>

<p>1832. <i>February 19th.</i>—Mr. Fleet, coachman
and part-proprietor of the Brighton and Tunbridge
Wells coach, killed by the overturn of his conveyance.</p>

<p>1832. <i>October 30th.</i>—Brighton Mail upset at
Reigate. Coachman killed on the spot. The
three outsides suffered fractured ribs and minor
injuries.</p>

<p>In 1833 the Marquis of Worcester, a shining
light of the road in those days, began that
connection with the Brighton Road which afterwards
produced the “Duke of Beaufort” coach,
made famous by the coloured prints after Lambert
and Shayer. He was passionately fond of driving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and was so very often allowed by the complaisant
professional coachmen to “take the ribbons” that
he at last fell into the habit of taking them almost
as a matter of right. Of course, the jarveys who
had relinquished the reins to him were always
well remembered for their so doing; but there
were those to whom money was not everything,
and in whose minds the sporting instinct was less
developed than a wholesome and ever-present
fear of the penalties to which coachmen were
liable if they permitted other persons to drive.
There could have been no objection on the score
of coachmanship, for the Marquis was an able
whip; but the fact remained that he could not
get the reins when he wanted them, and so in
revenge set up two coaches on the Brighton Road,
in alliance with a Jew named Israel Alexander.
A paltry fellow, this Marquis, afterwards seventh
Duke of Beaufort, to enter into competition with
professional coachmen in order to satisfy a
childish spite; not, at any rate, the high-souled
sportsman that toadies would have one believe.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After W. J. Shayer.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The coaches put on the road by this alliance
were the “Wonder” and the “Quicksilver,” both
with intent to run Goodman, the proprietor of the
“Times” coaches, off the route. The coachmen
who tooled these new conveyances were, of course,
always to give up the reins when my lord thought
proper to drive, and so the revenge was complete.
But the “Quicksilver,” a fast coach
timed to do the 52 miles in 4¾ hours, had
not been long on the road before it met with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103<br /><a id="Page_104">104</a><br /><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
a very serious accident, being overturned when
leaving Brighton on the evening of July 15th.
A booking-clerk, one John Snow, the son of a
coachman, and himself a sucking Jehu, was
driving, and upset the coach by the New Steyne,
with the result that the passengers were thrown
into the gardens of the Steyne, or hung upon the
spikes of the railings in very painful and ridiculous
postures. Goodman had the satisfaction of presently
learning that the bad-blooded sportsman
and his partner lost some very heavy sums in
compensation awards.</p>

<p>The “Quicksilver” was thereupon repainted
and renamed, and, under the alias of the
“Criterion,” resumed its journeys. But ill-fortune
clung to that coach, for on June 7th,
1834, as it was leaving London, it came into
collision with a brewer’s dray opposite St. Saviour’s
Church, Southwark. A little way on, down the
Borough High Street, the coachman was obliged
to suddenly pull up the horses to avoid running
over a gentleman on horseback, whose horse had
bolted into the middle of the road. The sudden
strain on the pole, already, it seems, splintered in
the affair with the dray, broke it off. It fell, and
became entangled with the legs of the wheelers,
who became so restive and infuriated that attempts
were made to put on the skid; but before that
could be done the coach overturned. Sir William
Cosway, who was one of the outsides, and
was at that moment attempting to climb down,
was pitched off so violently that his skull was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
fractured, so that he died in less than two
hours afterwards. A Mr. Todhunter “sustained”
(as the reporters have it) a broken thigh.</p>

<p>1834.—The London and Halifax Mail came
into collision with a bridge, five miles from
Sheffield. The coachman, Thomas Roberts, was
killed.</p>

<p>The Wolverhampton and Worcester coach, in
avoiding a cart coming down a hill near Stourbridge,
was upset, and a passenger killed.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>—A wheel came off one of Wheatley’s
Greenwich coaches at London Bridge, and one
gentleman was killed.</p>

<p>1835. <i>August.</i>—The Liverpool “Albion” fell
over on entering Whitchurch, through a worn-out
linchpin. A lady inside passenger was disfigured
for life.</p>

<p><i>June.</i>—The Nottingham “Rapid” upset, three
miles from Northampton, through the breaking
of an axle. A girl’s leg crushed, and afterwards
amputated.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>—The Newcastle and Carlisle Mail
upset, two miles from Hexham. Aiken, the
coachman, killed.</p>

<p><i>December 25th.</i>—The down Exeter Mail upset
on Christmas night, on nearing Andover, through
running against a bank in the prevailing fog.
Austin, the coachman, killed.</p>

<p>1836. <i>June.</i>—The up Louth Mail nearly upset
by stones maliciously placed in the road by some
unknown person, near Linger House bar. Rhodes,
the guard, was thrown off and seriously injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
In September, 1836, a shocking accident befel
the down Manchester “Peveril of the Peak,” five
miles from Bedford. The coach turned over, and
a gentleman named O’Brien was killed on the
spot. The coachman lay two hours under the
coach, and died from his injuries.</p>

<p>The next disaster on our list was caused by a
drunken coachman’s dazed state of mind. Early
on a Sunday morning in June, 1837, the Lincoln
and London Mails met and came into collision at
Lower Codicote, near Biggleswade. The driver
of the up mail, Thomas Crouch, was in a state
of partial intoxication at the time, and owing to
a curve in the road, and the wandering state of
his faculties, he did not observe the approach of
the other mail. The result was that, although
the coachman of the other made room for him to
pass, the two coaches came into violent collision.
The coach driven by Crouch was turned completely
round, ran twenty or thirty yards in a
direction opposite to that it was originally taking,
and finally settled in a leaning posture in the
ditch. Crouch was so injured that he died a few
hours afterwards. The passengers were not much
hurt, but two horses were killed.</p>

<p>On September 8th, a coachman named Burnett
was killed at Speenhamland, on the Bath Road.
He was driving one of the New Company’s London
and Bristol stages, and alighted at the “Hare
and Hounds,” very foolishly leaving the horses
unattended, with the reins on their backs. He
had been a coachman for twenty years, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
experience had not been sufficient to prevent
him thus breaking one of the first rules of the
profession. He had no sooner entered the inn
than the rival Old Company’s coach came down
the road. Whether the other coachman gave the
horses a touch with his whip as he passed, or if
they started on their own accord, is not known,
but they did start, and Burnett, rushing out to
stop them, was thrown down and trampled on
so that he died.</p>

<p>Of another kind was the fatal accident that
closed the year on the Glasgow Road. On the
night of December 18th, the up Glasgow Mail ran
over a man, supposed to have been a drunken
carter, who was lying in the middle of the
highway.</p>

<p>1837. <i>August.</i>—The up Glasgow Mail, the up
Edinburgh Mail, the Edinburgh and Dumfries,
and the Edinburgh and Portpatrick Mails all upset
the same night, at different places.</p>

<p>1838. <i>August.</i>—The London to Lincoln Express
met a waggon at night, at Mere Hall, six miles from
Lincoln. The coachman called to the waggoner
to make room, and a young man who, it is supposed,
was asleep on the top, started up, and rolled off.
The waggon-wheels went over and killed him.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>—The Edinburgh and Perth
“Coburg” was the subject of a singular accident.
Passengers and luggage were being received at
Newhall’s Pier, South Queensferry, when the
leader suddenly turned round, and before the
coachman and guard, who were stowing luggage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
could render assistance, coach and horses disappeared
over the quay-wall. Some of the
outsides saved their lives by throwing themselves
on the pier, but the four insides were less fortunate.
Two of them thrust their heads through the
windows, and so kept above the sea-water; the
other two—a Miss Luff and her servant—were
drowned. One outside, who had been flung far
out into the sea, could fortunately swim, and so
came ashore safe, but exhausted. Nine years
later, February 16th, 1847, a similar accident
happened to the Torrington and Bideford omnibus,
when the horses took fright and plunged with
the vehicle into the river from Bideford Quay.
Of the twelve passengers, ten were drowned.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>—The “Light Salisbury,” having met
the train at Winchfield Station, proceeded to Hurstbourne
Hill, between Basingstoke and Andover,
where the bit of one of the horses caught in the
pole and the coach was immediately overturned.
One passenger died the same afternoon, and
another was taken to his house at Andover without
the slightest hope of recovery. A young woman’s
leg was broken, and two other passengers’ limbs
were smashed.</p>

<p>The railway journals, which had even thus
early sprung into flourishing existence, did not
fail to notice the increasing number of coaching
accidents, the <i>Railway Times</i> with great gusto
reporting twenty in a few weeks. The prevalence
of these disasters was a cynical commentary upon
the “Patent Safety” coaches running on every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
road, warranted never to overturn and doing so with
wonderful regularity, and on those coaching prints
noticed by Charles Dickens—“coloured prints of
coaches starting, arriving, changing horses; coaches
in the sunshine, coaches in the wind, coaches in
the mist and rain, coaches in all circumstances
compatible with their triumph and victory; but
never in the act of breaking down, or overturning.”</p>

<p>The last years of coaching were, in fact, even
more fruitful in accidents than the old days.
Especially pathetic were the circumstances attendant
upon the disaster that overtook the “Lark”
Leicester and Nottingham Stage on May 23rd, 1840.
The coach was on its last journey when it occurred,
for the morrow was to witness the opening of the
railway between those places. Like most of these
last trips, the occasion was marked by much
circumstance. Crowds assembled to witness the
old order of things visibly pass away, and Frisby,
the coachman, had dolefully tied black ribbons
round his whipstock, to mark the solemnity of
the event. Unfortunately, that badge of mourning
proved in a little while to be only too appropriate,
for the well-loaded coach had only gone about a
mile and a half beyond Loughborough when Frisby,
who had been driving recklessly all the way,
and had several times been remonstrated with,
overturned it at Coates’ Mill. A Mr. Pearson
and another were killed. Pearson, who had
especially come to take part in this last drive,
was connected with the “Times” London and
Nottingham coach. He had been seated beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111<br /><a id="Page_112">112</a><br /><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Frisby, and had several times warned him, without
avail. His thighs were broken, and he received
a severe concussion of the brain, from which he
died at midnight. Frisby himself was crippled
for life.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>The pitcher goes oft to the well, but at last
it is broken; and so likewise the coachmen
who, winter and summer, storm or shine, had
driven for almost a generation over the same
well-known routes, at length met their death on
them in some unforeseen manner. A striking
instance of this was the sad end of William
Upfold—“unlucky Upfold”—who was coachman
of the “Times” Brighton and Southampton Stage,
a coach which ran by way of Worthing and
Chichester, he was a steady and reliable man,
fifty-four years of age, and had been a coachman
for thirty-five years, when fatal mischance slew
him on a February night, 1840. A singularly
long series of more or less serious accidents had
constantly attended him from 1831. In that year
his leg was broken in an upset, and he had only
just recovered and resumed his place when the
coach was overturned again, this time through
the breaking of an axle. The injuries he received
kept him a long time idle. Again, in January
1832, at Bosham, the furies were eager for
his destruction. He got off at the wayside inn,
and left the reins in the hands of a passenger,
who very foolishly alighted also, a minute or so
later. When Upfold saw him enter the inn he
hastily left it; but the horses had already started.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
In trying to stop them he was kicked on the
leg, and fell under the wheels, which passed over
him and broke the other leg.</p>

<p>Poor Upfold recovered at last, and might
have looked forward to immunity from any more
accidents; but Fate had not yet done with him.
When nearing Salvington Corner, one night in
February 1840, he was observed by Pascoe, a
coachman who was with him, to pull the wrong
rein in turning one of the awkward angles that
mark this stretch of road.</p>

<p>“Upfold, what are you at with the horses?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I have pulled the wrong rein,” said Upfold.</p>

<p>“Then mind and pull the right one this time,”
rejoined Pascoe; but scarcely had he said it when
the coach toppled over. Nearly every one was
hurt, but Upfold was killed. His pulling the
wrong rein was inexplicable. The unfortunate
man knew the road intimately, and the witnesses
declared he was absolutely sober; and so the
country-folk, who knew his history and how often
accidents had come his way, were reduced to
the fatalistic remark that “it had to be.”</p>

<p>1841. <i>November 8th.</i>—Rival coaches leaving
Skipton started racing on the Colne and Burnley
road. The horses of one grew unmanageable and
ran away. The passengers, alarmed, began to
jump off, and a Manchester man, name unknown,
who had been sitting beside the coachman, laid
hold of the reins to help the coachman pull the
horses in. In doing so, he pulled their heads to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
one side, and they dashed with appalling force
into a blank wall. He was killed on the spot.
All the passengers who had jumped off were more
or less seriously injured; but a woman and a boy,
who had remained quietly in their seats on the
roof, were unhurt.</p>

<p>1842. <i>January 17th.</i>—The “Nettle,” Welshpool
and Liverpool coach, overturned by a stone
near Newtown. Mr. Jones, of Gorward, Denbighshire,
a Dissenting minister, going to live at
Kerry, Montgomeryshire, was thrown off the
roof. He died two days later of his injuries, in
great agony.</p>

<p><i>December 28th.</i>—The Mail, coming south from
Caithness-shire, broke an axle at Latheronwheel
Bridge, and Donald Boss, the coachman, was
dashed from his box over the bridge into the rocky
burn, thirty feet below, and killed. The guard
had a narrow escape. Fortunately, there were
no passengers.</p>

<p>1843. <i>February 18th.</i>—The Cheltenham and
Aberystwith Mail left the “Green Dragon,” at
Hereford, on its way, and proceeded as usual to St.
Owen’s turnpike-gate. The gate was open, as a
matter of course, for the Mail, but the boisterous
wind blowing at the time sent it swinging back
across the road as the Mail passed. It hit the near
wheeler a violent blow and broke the trace and the
reins. Then rebounding, it struck the body of
the coach with such force that Eyles, the coachman,
was thrown off the box and killed. The
horses, thoroughly terrified, then ran away, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
meeting some donkey-carts on the road, ran into
them, injuring some old women driving from
market. One of them subsequently died from her
hurts.</p>

<p><i>March 22nd.</i>—The Norwich Day Coach upset
at Brentwood. The coachman, James Draing,
who was also proprietor, was killed.</p>

<p><i>April 21st.</i>—The Southampton and Exeter
Mail upset in the New Forest, two miles from
Stony Cross, by the horses, frightened at an overturned
waggon, running the coach up a bank.
Cherry, the coachman, met a dreadful death,
his head being literally split in two. A subscription
of £350 was raised for his widow and
six children.</p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>—The “Red Rover,” Ironbridge and
Wolverhampton coach, upset half a mile from
Madeley. One passenger, name unknown, killed.
He was described as “a very stout gentleman,
apparently about sixty years of age, dressed in
an invisible green coat and great-coat of the same
colour.”</p>

<p><i>June 26th.</i>—William Cooke, guard of the
Worcester coach, fell off his seat and was killed.</p>

<p><i>September 16th.</i>—The Ludlow and Bewdley
“Red Rover” overturned by the breaking of the
front axle. The coach was going slowly down-hill
at the time, and the wheel had the slipper on. It
was a heavily-loaded coach, and all the outsides
were violently thrown. A Mr. Thomas, a native
of Ludlow, fifty-seven years of age, retired from
business, was so seriously injured that he died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117<br /><a id="Page_118">118</a><br /><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
next day. At the inquest a deodand of £30 was
placed on the coach.</p>

  <div class="caption vtight"><p><span class="in6">ROAD VERSUS RAIL.</span>
<span class="fright"><i>After C. Cooper Henderson 1845.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>From this time forward the records of coaching
accidents grow fewer, and occur at longer intervals;
but only because coaches themselves were being
swiftly replaced by the railways, which had by
now come largely into their kingdom. Railway
accidents took their place, and the coaching artists
began to paint, and the printsellers to publish,
pictures like that of “Road <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> Rail” engraved
here, showing a very smart and well-appointed
coach bowling safely along the road, while a
railway accident in progress in the middle distance
attracts the elegant and rather smug attention
of coachman and passengers.</p>

<p>Every one now forgot the numerous casualties
of the old order of things—save, indeed,
the bereaved and the maimed, suffering from
the happenings of pure mischance, or from the
drunken or sporting folly of the coachmen.</p>

<p>But to the very last, in those outlying districts
to which the rail came late, and where the coaches
continued to ply regularly until the ’fifties, the
tragical possibilities of the road were insistent,
confounding the thorough-going sentimentalists
to whom the old times were everything that was
good, and the new, by consequence, altogether bad.
Listen to the moving tale of the Cheltenham
and Aberystwith down mail on a wild night
“about” 1852, according to the vague recollection
for dates of Moses James Nobbs.</p>

<p>Although torrents of rain had been falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
and the night was pitch dark, all went well with
the mail until nearing the Lugg Bridge, near
Hereford, where the little river Lugg, rushing
furiously in spate to join the Wye, had undermined
the masonry. No sooner did the horses
place their weight upon it than the arch gave
way, and the coachman, Couldery the guard, and
the one passenger, were precipitated into the
torrent and swept away for more than a mile
down stream. It was midnight when the accident
happened, and until daybreak the three, at
separate points, clung to rocks and branches, from
which they were then rescued by search-parties.
The coachman and guard recovered from the
exposure, but the passenger died.</p>

<p>Charles Ward, that fine old coachman, who
kept on the road in Cornwall for many years
after coaching had ceased over the rest of England,
tells amusingly of the happening that befell
the cross-country Bath and Devonport Mail, in
some year unspecified. It might have been a
most serious accident, but fortunately ended
happily. The coach was due to arrive at Devonport
at eleven o’clock at night. On this particular
occasion all the outside passengers, except
a Mrs. Cox, an “immense woman,” who kept
a fish-stall in Devonport Market, had been set
down at Yealmpton, where the coachman and
guard usually had their last drain. They went,
as usual, into the inn, and very considerately
sent out to Mrs. Cox a glass of “something
warm,” it being a very cold night. The servant-girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
who took out that cheering glass was not
able to reach up to the roof, and so the ostler,
who was holding the horses’ heads, very imprudently
left them, to do the polite, when the
animals, hearing some one getting on the coach,
and thinking (for coach-horses did actually do
something like it) that it was the coachman,
started off, and trotted at their ordinary speed
the whole seven miles to the door of the “King’s
Arms” at Plymouth, where they were in the
habit of stopping to discharge some of the coach-freight.
On their way they had to cross the
Laira Bridge and through the toll-bar, and did so,
keeping clear of everything on the road in as
workmanlike a manner as though the skilfullest
of whips was directing their course. Mrs. Cox,
however, was terrified. Afraid to scream lest
she should startle the horses, she had to content
herself with gesticulating and trying to attract
the attention of the people met or passed on the
road. When the horses drew up in an orderly
fashion at the “King’s Arms,” and the ostlers
came bustling out to attend to their duties, they
were astonished to see no one but the affrighted
Mrs. Cox on the outside, and two inside
passengers, who had been in total ignorance of
what was happening. The coachman and guard,
in a very alarmed state, soon came up in a post-chaise.
It took many quarterns of gin to steady
the nerves of the proprietress of the fish-stall,
and the incident became the chief landmark of
her career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
We will conclude this chapter of accidents on
this lighter and less sombre note, and tell how
humour sometimes remained in the foreground
even if the possibilities of tragedy lurked threatening
in the rear. The tale used often to be told
on the Exeter Road how, on one occasion, when
Davis was driving the up “Quicksilver” Mail
between Bagshot and Staines on a dark night,
he ran into some obstruction, and the coach was
upset into the adjoining field, fortunately a wet
meadow. The “insides” were asleep at the time,
and they naturally awoke in the wildest alarm.
One, who did not grasp the situation, called out,
“Coachman, coachman, where are we?” “By
God, sir,” replied Davis, “I don’t know, for I
was never here before in all my life!” Happily,
nobody and nothing was hurt, and in twenty
minutes the coach was away, making up for
lost time.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V" class="vspace">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subhead">A GREAT CARRYING FIRM: THE STORY OF
PICKFORD AND CO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">To</span> the incurious public, who are as familiar with
the name of “Pickford’s” as with that of their
favourite morning newspaper, and to whom the
sight of one of Pickford’s vans is a mere commonplace
of daily life, this great carrying firm is just
a part of our modern commercial system. To
suggest to that favourite abstraction—the “average
man”—so commonly cited, that Pickford’s is a
firm whose origin is to be traced back two hundred
and fifty or three hundred years would be a rash
thing. He would tell you that this is a firm of
railway carriers, and that, as railways are not yet
a hundred years old, Pickford’s certainly cannot
be two centuries older.</p>

<p>Thus do later changes overlie and conceal
earlier methods of business.</p>

<p>Our average citizen would be wrong in two
things: in his premisses, that the firm is wholly
one of railway carriers; and in his conclusions,
that it came into existence with railways themselves.
The origin of Pickford’s is, indeed, lost in
the mists that gather round the social and commercial
life of the early seventeenth century; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the beginnings of the business go back to that
time when the original firm of packhorse carriers
was established, to whose trade the Pickfords
succeeded, by purchase or otherwise, about 1730.
Traditions only survive of those long-absorbed
carriers, whose packhorse trains originally plied
on the hilly tracks between Derby and Manchester
“about two hundred and fifty or three hundred
years ago,” as we vaguely learn. No documentary
or other evidence exists on which to found an
account of them. What would we not give to
be able to recover from the romantic past the
story of those old-time carriers, contemporary with
the famous Hobson himself, beyond comparison
the most celebrated of all these old men of the
road!</p>

<p>But all records have been destroyed. When
the several changes were made that from time to
time altered the constitution of the business, the
papers and documents relating to past transactions
were cast aside as waste-paper, and there was none
among the people of those times who thought it
worth while, for the interest and instruction
of posterity, to set down what he knew of the
current history of the concern. That this should
have been the case is no matter for surprise. The
past or the future interests many to whom the
present is only something from which to escape,
as commonplace and dull. That man who is not
glad, when the business day is done, to leave for
home and straightway dismiss all thoughts of his
business from his mind is rare indeed; and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
more rare he who finds interest, beyond mere
money-getting, in the daily commerce by which
he lives and prospers.</p>

<p>About 1770 Matthew Pickford, the representative,
in the second or third generation, of that
family in this olden firm, is found established in
Manchester, a town then making rapid industrial
progress, and affording great scope for the carrying
trade, already, for some years past, conducted by
waggons; but we do not obtain any details of his
business until November 16th, 1776, when he
issued the following advertisement, afterwards
inserted in <cite>Prescott’s Manchester Journal</cite> for
Saturday, January 4th, 1777:—</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="in6">
<p class="hang drop-cap">
<span class="smcap1">“THIS</span> is to acquaint all Gentlemen,<br />
Tradesmen, and Others, that Mat.<br />
<span class="in3">Pickford’s Flying Waggons to</span><br />
<span class="in3">London in Four Days and a Half</span>
</p></div>

<p class="in0">Set out from the Swan and Saracen’s Head, in
Market Street Lane, Manchester, every Wednesday,
at Six o’clock in the Evening, and arrive
at the Swan Inn, Lad Lane, London, the Tuesday
noon following; also set out every Saturday
at the same Hour, and arrive there on Friday
noon following. Set out from London every
Wednesday and Saturday, and arrive at Manchester
every Tuesday and Friday; which carry
goods and passengers to and from Manchester,
Stockport, Macclesfield, Leek, Blackburn, Bolton,
Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Line, and
places adjacent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
“N.B.—M. Pickford will not be accountable
for any Money, Plate, Watches, Jewels, Writings,
Glass, China, etc., unless entered as such, and paid
for accordingly.</p>

<p>“Constant attention at the above Inns in
London and Manchester, to take in Goods, etc.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that these “four days and
a half” trips, although performed by “Flying
Waggons,” and presumably much swifter than
some earlier ones of which we have no record,
were only four and a half days in a very special
sense, and by the exercise of some peculiar method
of reckoning whose secret has not descended to
us. It might seem, to the person of ordinary
intelligence, that these were really itineraries
of rather more than five days and a half;
but the Sunday was doubtless a day of rest
for the waggoners, as for most others in those
times.</p>

<p>In 1780, according to the evidence afforded
by an old billhead, still preserved, Matthew Pickford
was carrying on business in conjunction with
Thomas, his brother, and in this partnership they
continued to trade for many years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the manufacturing industries of
Lancashire and the north-west had grown enormously,
and canals were already being dug to
aid the transport of goods. We have no means
of knowing in how far the Pickfords took
advantage of the early canals in the Midlands,
but that they availed themselves very greatly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the opportunities afforded by them of extending
their business seems unlikely, in view of the position
in 1817, when they admitted Joseph Baxendale
as a partner into the concern.</p>

<p>Joseph Baxendale was thirty-two years of age
when he became partner in the firm of Pickford
&amp; Co. He was born in 1785, the son of Josiah
Baxendale, of Lancaster, and had already seen
something of business as partner in the concern
of Swainson &amp; Co., calico-printers at Preston,
whose firm he left to seek those wider activities
for which his active mind longed. For there was
something adventurous in his blood, which would
by no means permit him merely to take the
sedentary part of a capitalist in any enterprise
in whose fortunes he might acquire a share. An
opportunity thoroughly suited to his temperament
was this which offered, of becoming a partner in
the already old-established firm of Pickford’s.
We have now no means of knowing precisely on
what terms he joined the two brothers, but whatever
the pecuniary consideration may have been,
enough survives to tell us that his youthful
activities and his keen business intelligence were
prominent in what he brought into the firm. For
many years Matthew and Thomas had borne the
whole conduct of the business, and it was now
desirable, both by reason of their advancing years
and the natural growth of the commercial activities
of the country, that they should have, allied with
them, one who, alike by inclination and urged
by business interests, would scour the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
supervising and organising, as they no longer found
it possible to do.</p>

<p>Baxendale found plenty of work of this nature
awaiting him. The staff of horses which the
Pickfords had found sufficient for their needs in
bygone years had been little, if at all, increased,
although a period of great trade-expansion had
set in; and a total lack of efficient supervision
over agents and carmen had resulted in the carrying
business being dilatory and untrustworthy.
Under these circumstances, it is not surprising
that rival firms had begun to threaten the very
existence of Pickford’s, declining under the
nerveless rule, by which the needs of the time
were not understood.</p>

<p>It was soon impressed upon the new partner’s
active and penetrating intelligence that the requirements
of the time, and still more the requirements
of the succeeding years, imperatively
demanded a thorough reorganisation—more
thorough, perhaps, than the old partners were
altogether ready to concede. He soon acquired
entire control, and the Pickfords, unable or
unwilling to meet new times with new methods,
left their already historic business and its destinies
in his hands.</p>

<p>He speedily altered the aspect of affairs. Soon
he had close upon a thousand horses, all his own,
on the great roads between London and the north-west;
while advertisements were issued, announcing
“Caravans on Springs and Guarded, carrying
Goods only, every afternoon at 6 o’clock,” from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
London and Manchester, taking only 36 hours
to perform the 186 miles.</p>

<p>To this, then, the “caravan” had come at last.
Travellers from the Far East had originally
brought the word to England. They had seen
the Persian <em>kārwāns</em> toiling under those torrid
skies—covered waggons in whose shady interiors
the poor folks travelled; and when the first stage-waggons
were established in England, they were
often known by an English version of that name.
Some of the caravans of the late seventeenth
century were, however, by no means the rough-and-ready
affairs generally supposed, if we may
judge from the description of one offered for sale
in the <cite>London Gazette</cite> of May 6th, 1689. This,
according to the vendors, was:—</p>

<p>“A Fair easie going Caravan, with a very
handsom Roof Brass Work, good Seats. Glasses
on the sides to draw up; that will carry 18 Persons,
with great Conveniency for Carriage of
Goods, so well built that it is fit for Carriage
of all manner of Goods—to be sold.”</p>

<p>But there was one more change before the
caravan in 1817. Already the popular voice,
unwilling to enunciate three syllables when one
could be made to serve, had clipped the name
to “van,” and as vans all covered vehicles of the
kind have been known ever since.</p>

<p>At the time when Baxendale appeared upon
the scene the headquarters of the business were
still at Manchester, and the London establishments
had been for many years past at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
“Castle,” Wood Street, and the “White Bear,”
Basinghall Street. To the first house, then a
galleried inn of the ancient type, at the corner
of Wood Street and what is now Gresham Street,
but was then Lad Lane, the London and Manchester
waggons and caravans resorted; and to
and from the “White Bear” went the Leicester
and Nottingham traffic.</p>

<p>Coming with a fresh mind to the carrying
problems that confronted the firm, the new partner
decided that London, and not Manchester, ought
to be its central point, and so soon as he obtained
control he accordingly removed the head offices
to the Metropolis. Canal-traffic, too, engaged
his earnest attention, and the scope of the firm’s
activities were extended enormously in that direction.
The Regent’s Canal was opened in 1820,
and when that opening took place the newly built
wharves of Pickford &amp; Co. were ready, beside the
City Basin. To and from that point came and
went the water-borne trade, in the fly-boats of
the firm, simultaneously with the fly-vans on the
roads.</p>

<p>These developments brought other changes,
and in 1826 the existing headquarter offices of
Pickford &amp; Co. were built in Gresham Street,
adjoining the “Castle” Inn.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>It will be interesting to see what was the
cost of carriage of goods at this period. It was
the carriers’ Golden Age, when, for distances of
a little over a hundred miles from London—as,
for example, Leicester and Birmingham—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131<br /><a id="Page_132">132</a><br /><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
carriage of goods by waggon or caravan could
be charged at 5<i>s.</i> per cwt., or £5 per ton; when
by coach the rates for small parcels were 1<i>d.</i> a
pound; and even by canal—that last effort in
cheap transport before railways—the charges were
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per cwt., or £2 15<i>s.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>He who reorganised the old business of Pickford’s
demands extended notice in these pages. A
portrait of him, a three-quarter length, painted
by Pickersgill, R.A., about 1847, has the illusion
common to all three-quarter-length portraits of
giving an appearance of great stature. Mr. Baxendale
was a man of broad shoulder, and not above
the middle height. While in many respects a
good portrait of him, it is said by those who knew
him best to fail in not giving expression to the
native kindliness and humour that underlaid his
keen business instincts. “Cheerful and witty in
conversation,” says one who knew him well, “he
ever had a word of encouragement for the youngsters,
and was universally beloved by those whom
he employed.”</p>

<p>To those who served him to the best of their
ability he was a never-failing friend, and, at a
time when business firms did not usually trouble
themselves about the comfort of their servants,
took pains to secure their well-being. In the
galleries of the old “Castle” Inn he constructed
a coffee- and club-room for his carmen, and provided
similar conveniences at his other establishments.
The old inn has long been demolished,
but the headquarters of the firm still remains next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
door, and adjoins the modern Railway Goods
Receiving Office of the “Swan with Two Necks,”
built on the site of the old coaching establishment
of Chaplin’s.</p>

<p>Never was such a man for improving maxims
as Joseph Baxendale. He was a great admirer
of <i>Poor Richard’s Almanack</i> and its racy maxims,
written by Daniel Webster, and carefully caused
a broadsheet containing a selection of them to be
printed. He also tried his own hand at composing
pithy sentences on the virtues of punctuality and
method, and caused leaflets of these, together
with <i>Poor Richard’s</i> homely literature, to be
circulated and posted in all conspicuous places
in the establishments of Pickford &amp; Co. in London
and the provinces, and on the roads and canals
where his vans travelled or his fly-boats voyaged.
Here is one of his compositions in this way:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">METHOD</span> is the very Hinge of Business; and
there is no Method without Punctuality.
Punctuality is important, because it subserves the
Peace and good Temper of a Family: The want
of it not only infringes on necessary Duty, but
sometimes excludes this Duty. The Calmness of
Mind which it produces, is another Advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
of Punctuality: A disorderly man is always in
a hurry; he has no time to speak to you, because
he is going elsewhere; and when he gets there,
he is too late for his business; or he must hurry
away to another before he can finish it. Punctuality
gives weight to Character. “Such a man
has made an Appointment:—then I know he
will keep it.” And this generates punctuality in
you; for, like other Virtues, it propagates itself.
Servants and Children must be punctual, where
their Leader is so. Appointments, indeed, become
Debts. I owe you Punctuality, if I have made
an Appointment with you: and have no right to
throw away your time, if I do my own.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, this good advice and insistence upon
its being followed would have been of little avail
had the author of it not been continually alert
to see that his instructions took root. <em>He</em>, at any
rate, practised what he preached, and rose early,
was diligent all day, and went late to bed. As a
business man whose business was conducted over
a large stretch of country—extending chiefly in a
diagonal line two hundred miles long, between
London and Liverpool—he knew that only by
personal supervision and by great and unwearied
exertions in travelling could his subordinates be
kept in a state of efficiency; and he accordingly
was always travelling. By post-chaise or by
private carriage he flew, day and night, along
the great roads between London and Holyhead,
and London, Derby, Manchester and Liverpool;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
appearing, suddenly and unexpectedly, at some
great town-warehouse of the firm, or some wayside
office or place of call, and often springing, as it
were, out of the void, to encourage some diligent
servant, or (it is to be feared) more often to
reprimand a lazy and inefficient one. None could
predicate his movements or where he might be at
any given time; save indeed those with whom
he had made appointments, and they knew, after
only a short acquaintance, that the sun was scarce
more likely to rise and set according to the
calendar than Joseph Baxendale was to redeem
his promise of any such assignation.</p>

<p>Forsaking for awhile the roads and his establishments
along them, he would next appear on
the canals of whose sullen waters his fly-boats
flew, and pay flying visits of inspection to the
many wharves along their course. These water
expeditions were made in a vessel especially
constructed—a “canal-yacht” called the <i>Lark</i>,
whether significantly named in allusion to the
early-rising habits of its owner we do not know.
It was this boat, according to the still surviving
tradition, he lent to the Earl of Derby on an
occasion when Lady Derby was in London, too
ill to travel by road to Knowsley, where,
according to the doctor’s advice, she should be
removed. In it she travelled all the way down
to Lancashire, along the canals.</p>

<p>Another surviving tradition, and one that
speaks well for the quality of the horses that drew
the fly-boats—and perhaps even better for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
keenness of the sporting instincts of the official
concerned—-tells how Mr. Baxendale, on coming
to Braunston, a Northamptonshire village on the
Grand Junction Canal, discovered that the man
who should have been in charge of his wharf there
had gone hunting, mounted on one of the firm’s
towing-path steeds. Records of that time do
not tell us of that sportsman’s return, or of the
reception that met him.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a consequence of the strenuous
rule then obtaining that, at a time when the great
roads to the north were blocked by the historic
snowstorm of Christmas 1836, when the stage-coaches
and the mails were buried in the drifts,
Pickford’s Manchester Flying Van was first
through. We may suppose that the horses were
better specimens than those pictured here, from an
old painting, which represents the fly-van team
as a very sorry one indeed, comparing badly with
the sturdy animals who are seen drawing the van
in the first picture.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to think that Baxendale’s
ways with his staff were merely those of the
strict disciplinarian, only anxious to obtain the
utmost from them. His kindliness was perhaps
his strongest point, and Pickford’s under his rule
began the practice of recognising the loyalty and
hard work of their servants by pensioning them on
their retirement—a policy that still does honour
to the firm.</p>

<p>Under this vigorous sway Pickford’s grew and
prospered, and by the time when railways first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
loomed threatening upon the horizon of the
carriers’ and coachmen’s outlook, commanded the
bulk of the goods traffic between London and the
Midlands, alike by road and canal. That was a
period above all others when a clear head was
requisite. It appeared to many to be a choice
between giving up business or fighting the encroachments
of steam. To the few, of whom
Baxendale was one, the issues were more varied
and hopeful. He foresaw that railways must
succeed, and that, since to fight them would be
hopeless, the best thing to do would be to work
with them as far as possible. The business
need not be injured; indeed, he saw that it must
needs share in whatever prosperity attended the
railways. Only methods must be changed. But
to reorganise a vast business only just, after
thirteen years of unwearied effort, re-established
on new and improved lines, must have seemed a
hard necessity. However, when the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway, the second line in the
country, was about to be opened, in 1830, he
perceived that although the road traffic must cease
between the two terminal points of a railway,
yet there must be some agency prepared to collect
goods, and deliver them to or convey them from
the railway stations. He saw, too, an inevitable
increase in the volume of traffic, and very prudently
resolved to obtain a share of it by throwing
in his lot with the railway people, who were
themselves not so assured of instant success as
to repel so unexpected an offer, and welcomed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139<br /><a id="Page_140">140</a><br /><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
proposed alliance. The same attitude was adopted
towards the Grand Junction Railway and the
London and Birmingham. In this far-seeing policy
Baxendale was at one with William Chaplin, who
at an early period in the history of railway enterprise
had called upon him and asked him what
his views were on this vital question. Chaplin
withdrew his coaches when the London and
Birmingham Railway was opened, and Pickford’s
fly-vans and fly-boats ceased to run. In return
for these really valuable services, Pickford’s, and
Chaplin and his coaching ally, Horne, who had
been equally complaisant, acquired shares in the
town and country carrying agencies for what in
1845 became an amalgamation of railway interests
under the style and title of the “London and
North-Western Railway.” Unused as these new
railway people were to the business of handling
goods, they were glad enough that Mr. Baxendale
should organise that class of traffic for them, and,
as we have already said, really welcomed the aid
thus somewhat unexpectedly forthcoming, although
outwardly adopting a self-sufficient and omnipotent
attitude. He became organising goods-manager,
and contributed the services of his staff to the
work, but resigned when everything had been
duly set going to devote himself to his own
business. He it was who drew up the documents
still used in the goods departments of railways to
this day, in all essentials unaltered.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile his anticipations were justified by
the course of events, Railways did but alter the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
methods of the carrying trade. They not only
did not destroy it, but, in the altered shape it took,
increased it fifty-fold. No fewer than twenty-one
district managers became necessary to the conduct
of the business, which at length gave employment
to between three and four thousand people.</p>

<p>The central figure of this successful reorganisation
became, like William Chaplin, a power
in the railway world. He was for some years
Chairman of the South-Eastern Railway, and in
that capacity strongly urged the purchase of
Folkestone Harbour, an undertaking then in the
market. His co-directors did not at the time
agree with the proposal, but eventually came
round to his way of thinking, and brought up the
subject again. Meanwhile he had privately purchased
the harbour. The high sense of duty that
characterised him led to his considering that, as
Chairman of the Railway Company, and as therefore
trustee of the interests of the projectors, he
could not retain the property, and he accordingly
transferred it at the price he had given. He
was at the same time a director of the Great
Northern Railway of France, but was in 1848,
in consequence of a severe illness, obliged to
resign some of these activities, together with the
detailed management of Pickford’s, which he then
left in the hands of his three sons, but never gave
up control of the business. He had in the meantime
purchased an estate at Woodside Park,
Whetstone, where he resided. He died there,
March 24th, 1872, in his eighty-seventh year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
The portrait of him, as he was in the full vigour
of his manhood, hangs amid the old-time relics
still cherished in the Gresham Street offices—among
the muskets and the blunderbusses carried
by the guards of his fly-vans in the old days
of the road.</p>

<span class="subhead">ROBBERY AND ADVENTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> whole art and mystery of coach-robbing
began to be studied at a very early date. In
the <cite>London Gazette</cite> during 1684 we find the
following extremely explicit advertisement:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">“A GENTLEMAN</span> (passing with others in the
Northampton Stage Coach on Wednesday the
14th instant, by Harding Common about two miles
from Market-street) was set upon by four Theeves,
plain in habit but well-horsed, and there (amongst
other things) robbed of a Watch; the description of
it thus, The Maker’s Name was engraven on the
Back plate in French, Gulimus Petit à Londres; it
was of a large round Figure, flat, Gold Enamelled
without, with variety of Flowers of different colours,
and within a Landskip, and by a fall the Enamel was
a little cracked; It had also a black Seale-Skin plain
Case lined with Green Velvet. If any will produce
it, and give notice to Mr. Samuel Gibs, Sadler near
the George Inn Northampton, or to Mr. Cross in
Wood Street, London, he shall have a Guinea reward.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be feared that the gentleman who
thus mourned his watch never regained it.</p>

<p>From this time forward, until well into
the nineteenth century, highwaymen and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
highway-robbery of postboys, stage-coaches, post-chaises,
and all sorts and conditions of wayfarers
became commonplaces of travel. Dick Turpin’s
name has acquired an undue prominence, on
account of Harrison Ainsworth elevating him
upon a pedestal, as the hero of a romance, but
his was really neither a prominent nor an heroic
figure. Innumerable other practitioners surpassed
him. Claude Du Vall, who robbed and danced
on Hounslow Heath; Abershaw, the terror of
the Surrey Commons; Captain Hind, soldier
and gentleman, warring with authority; Boulter,
whose depredations were conducted all over the
kingdom; the “Golden Farmer” on the Exeter
Road, outside Bagshot: all these and very
many more were infinitely superior to Turpin,
and, as they phrased it, “spoke to” the coaches
with great success during their brief but crowded
career. Nowadays, we hear much of overcrowded
professions; but those of the Army, the Church,
and the Law are by no means so crowded as
were the ranks of the liberal profession of highway
robbery in the brave nights of crape mask
and horse-pistols at the cross-roads on the blasted
heaths which then encompassed the Metropolis;
lonesome places of dreadful possibilities, which
could not have been more conveniently placed
for the purpose of these night-hawks had they
been expressly designed for them.</p>

<p>Travellers, who looked upon being robbed once
upon a journey as the inevitable thing, very
soon discovered this overcrowded state of affairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
and resented it. Once upon a time, after the
gentry who plied their occupation on Hounslow
Heath and Finchley or Putney Commons had
taken toll of purse and pocket, travellers had gone
their way chuckling at the store of notes and gold
still safe in their boots and the lining of their
coats; but when every reckless blade and every
discharged footman or disbanded soldier took
to the road, the polite highwayman of the
recognised robbing-places had no sooner been
left behind with a “good-night to you”—mutual
good wishes and a hearty <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au revoir!</i> from Du Vall
or one of his brethren—than the territory of an
unsuspected set of ruffians was entered; rough-and-ready
customers, who were not content until
they had got the passengers’ boots off, or had
ripped up the linings of coats and waistcoats,
and then, having taken the last stiver, bade those
unhappy passengers, with a curse, begone. There
was an even deeper depth of misery—when, thus
shorn and stripped, they encountered a yet more
rascally, more provincial and hungrier crew, who
in their exasperation at getting nothing, would
sometimes resort to personal violence, to vent
their disappointment and ill-humour.</p>

<p>At this overcrowded period, when the ordinary
course of business failed, the highwaymen were
even known to practise upon one another, like
the Stock Exchange brokers of to-day, who,
when the public hold aloof, sharpen their wits
and fill their pockets by professional dealings.</p>

<p>In 1758 the monotony of highway robbery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
was broken by a burglary at the “Bull and
Mouth” coach-office, at 3 o’clock one morning,
when 47 parcels, chiefly containing plate and
watches, were stolen. The booty was valued at
£500. The thieves carried the parcels away
in a cart, and left behind them a lighted candle,
which would have burned the place down had
it not been discovered in time by a coachman.</p>

<p>This was followed in May 1766 by an incident
standing out in highly humorous relief. The
<cite>Public Advertiser</cite> in that month announced:—“A
few nights ago, among the passengers that
were going in the stage from Bath to London,
were two supposed females that had taken outside
places. As they were climbing to their seats it
was observed that one of them had men’s shoes
and stockings on, and upon further search,
Breeches were discovered also: this consequently
alarming the company, the person thus disguised
was taken into custody and locked up for the
night. The next day he was brought before a
magistrate, and upon a strict examination into
matters, it appeared that he was a respectable
tradesman who, having cash and bills to a large
amount on him, thus disguised himself to escape
the too urgent notice of the ‘Travelling Collectors.’”</p>

<p>Turnpike Trusts at this time encouraged
Sabbatarian feeling by charging double on
Sundays; but “knowing” travellers sometimes
travelled on that day, and submitted to that
imposition as the cheaper of two evils. The one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
they thus escaped was the imminent risk of being
molested by highwaymen and stripped of all their
valuables; for those gay “Collectors,” as they
delighted to style themselves, did not attend to
business on the Sabbath. We are not, from this,
to suppose that the highwaymen were at church,
or at home, reading improving literature. Not at
all: they did not expect wayfarers, and so took
the day off. The Sunday Trading Act for many
years forbidding Lord’s Day employment, prevented
coaches running then, and so helped to give the
hard-worked nocturnal gentlemen of the road their
needed weekly rest, and ensured them from missing
very much. Yet anxious travellers did sometimes
go on Sundays, and risk an information. When
at last the mail-coaches were started, to go seven
times a week, and the Post Office itself set the
example of Sunday travel, away went the highwayman’s
week-ends and the travellers’ respite
from wayside “Stand and deliver!” The stages
then plied on Sundays also.</p>

<p>As for the mails, they were immune from
attack. The Post Office early issued a warning
against sending gold by them; but it did so, not
from fear of the highwaymen, but “from the
prejudice it does the coin by the friction.” Highwaymen
were, in fact, little feared either by the
Department or by the mail-passengers, for not
only did the guard’s embattled condition secure
them from attack, but the Post Office introduced
enactments dealing very severely with highway
robbery applied to the mail-coaches. The standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
reward offered the liege-subjects of the king for
arresting an ordinary highwayman was raised
to £200 in the case of an attack on the mail,
further augmented by another £100 if within five
miles of London. Mail-coaches, by consequence,
were left severely alone by the Turpins, Abershaws,
and others of their kind; and it has been
said that a mail-coach, unlike the old postboys
carrying the mail-bags, was never attacked.</p>

<p>Although this is very likely true, it must not
be supposed that the mails were never robbed.
The distinction drawn is clear. Violence was not
shown, but robberies were frequent, often on a
sensational scale. One February night in 1810,
some unknown persons wrenched off the lock of
the hind-boot on one of the mails and made away
with no fewer than sixteen North-Country bags.
Where was the guard? Probably kissing the
pretty barmaid. Again, on November 9th, in that
same year, nine bags were stolen from a mail at
Bedford; and so frequent grew robberies of all
sorts that in January 1813 the Superintendent
of Mails was constrained to issue a warning notice
to his officials:—“The guards are desired by
Mr. Hasker to be particularly attentive to their
mail-box. Depredations are committed every
night on some stage-coaches by stealing parcels.
I shall relate a few, which I trust will make
you circumspect. The Bristol mail-coach has
been robbed within a week of the bankers’ parcel,
value £1000 or upwards. The Bristol mail-coach
was robbed of money the 3rd instant to a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
amount. The ‘Expedition’ coach has been twice
robbed in the last week—the last time of all the
parcels out of the seats. The ‘Telegraph’ was
robbed last Monday night between the Saracen’s
Head, Aldgate, and Whitechapel Church, of all
the parcels out of the dicky. It was broken open
while the guard was on it, standing up blowing
his horn. The York mail was robbed of parcels
out of the seats to a large amount.”</p>

<p>Many of these robberies cited by Hasker were,
it will be noticed, from stage-coaches. Despite
this warning note, small thefts continued. Then,
in 1822, came the classic instance—the robbery
from the Ipswich Mail, when notes worth
£31,198 mysteriously disappeared. A month later
the bulk of them, to the value of £28,000, was
returned, only a few, worth £3000, having been
successfully negotiated. On the night of June 6th,
1826, seven bags were taken from the Dover Mail
between Chatham and Rainham; and in the following
year a new sensation was provided by the
Warwick Mail being robbed of £20,000.</p>

<p>But the closing great robbery of the coaching
age was that of £5000 in notes from the “Potter”
(Manchester and Stafford) coach, October 1839.
The notes, in a parcel addressed to a bank at
Hanley, were extracted from the hind-boot when
the coach was near Congleton.</p>

<p>Adventures, says the proverb, are to the
adventurous; but in coaching times they befell
those who desired a quiet life, equally with
the seekers after sensation and experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Fortunately for the peace of mind of our grandfathers,
the startling adventure that befell the up
Exeter Mail at Winterslow Hut, on the night of
October 20th, 1816, was unique. The coach had
left Salisbury in the usual way, and had proceeded
several miles, when what was thought to be a
large calf was seen trotting beside the horses in
the darkness. When the lonely inn of Winterslow
Hut was reached, the team had become extremely
nervous, and could scarcely be kept under control.
At the moment when the coachman pulled up,
one of the horses was seized by the supposed calf,
and the others of the terrified team began to kick
and plunge violently. The guard very promptly
drew his blunderbuss, and was about to shoot
this mysterious assailant, when several men,
accompanied by a large mastiff, came on the
scene; and it appeared that this ferocious “calf”
was really a lioness, escaped from a travelling
menagerie, and these men come in pursuit. The
dog was holloaed on to the attack, and the lioness
thereupon left the horse, and, seizing him, tore the
wretched animal to pieces.</p>

<p>At length she was secured by a rope, and taken
off in captivity. The leading horse was fearfully
mangled, but survived, and was exhibited for a
time, with great financial success, by the showman
whose lioness had wrought the mischief.
When the interest had subsided, “Pomegranate”—for
that was the name of the horse—was sold.
He had been foaled in 1809, and was a thoroughbred,
with rather too much spirit for his owner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
who had sold him out of his stable for his bad
temper. The severe work in coaches of that
period soon took the unruly nature out of such
animals, and no complaint was made of him in
his long after-career on the Brighton and Petworth
stage-coach.</p>

<p>This exciting episode was, of course, the
wonder of that age, and two coaching artists
made capital out of it, in the shape of very
effective plates. James Bollard was the author
of one; the other was by one Sauerweid, whose
name is not familiar in work of this kind.</p>

<p>Dark nights in wild country were fruitful in
strange experiences, aided, doubtless, by the
potency of the parting glass as well as by the
blackness of the night and the ruggedness of
the way. The adventures of Jack Creery and
Joe Lord, coachman and guard of the pair-horse
Lancaster and Kirkby Stephen Mail, one snowy
night, form a case in point. They had the coach
to themselves, for it was not good travelling
weather. Creery, we are told, “felt sleepy”—a
pretty way of saying he was intoxicated—and
so the guard took the reins. In driving, this
worthy, whose condition seems to have been
only a shade better than that of his companion,
wandered in the snow into a by-lane between
Kirkby Stephen and Kirkby Lonsdale, and so lost
his way. After floundering about for some time,
he aroused Creery, and their united efforts, after
alighting many times to read the signposts,
brought them in the middle of the night to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153<br /><a id="Page_154">154</a><br /><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
village, where they were found by the aroused
villagers loudly knocking at the church door,
under the impression that it was a public-house.
That snowstorm must have been a particularly
blinding one, or the brandy at their last house
of call unusually strong.</p>

<p>Not often was coaching history marked by
such a gruesome incident as that which befell a
coach on the Norwich Road. At Ingatestone a
lady, who was the only inside passenger, was
discovered to have died. Her son, travelling
outside, was informed, but after some hesitation
it was decided that the coach should proceed to
its destination at Colchester. At Chelmsford,
however, two ladies presented themselves as
would-be passengers. Inside seats only were
available, all the outsides being occupied. They
were informed of the circumstances, and that
they could therefore not be booked; but were
so anxious to go by the coach that they overcame
their natural scruples, and rode with the
dead woman to the journey’s end.</p>

<p>Of winter travelling we have already heard
something, and shall hear more. How it struck
one contemporary with those times we may learn
from a reminiscent old traveller, who, having had
much experience of old coaching methods, preferred
the railway age—at least in winter. Thus
he recalls some of his experiences:—</p>

<p>“For a day and night journey the agony was,
on two occasions, so intense that, although then
in my youth, and hardy enough, I was obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
get off the coach and sleep a night on the road;
by which I don’t mean under the hedge, but in
one of those fine old (and highly expensive) inns
that then were to be found at more or less regular
intervals along the great highways. Posting,
generally with four horses—a highly extravagant
way of travelling, but one in great favour with
those who could afford it—maintained correspondingly
high charges at all these houses of entertainment.
It was all very well to rhapsodise
over the climbing roses, the fragrant honeysuckle
and the odorous jessamine that wreathed the
portals of the wayside inn in summer, or to become
eloquent over the roaring fire, at whose ruddy
blaze you toasted your feet in winter, but you
had to pay—and to pay pretty heavily—for these
luxuries. I will suppose that the traveller stopped
for dinner, which, if left to the landlady, generally
consisted of eels, or other fresh-water fish, dressed
in a variety of ways, roast fowl, lamb or mutton
cutlets, bread, cheese, and celery, for which a
charge of six or seven shillings was made. If
the meal took place after dark, there was an
additional item of two shillings or half a crown
for wax lights. Then, ‘for the good of the house’
and your own certain discomfort, there was a
bottle of fine crusted port (probably two days in
bottle) seven shillings; or a bottle of fiery sherry,
just drawn from the wood, six shillings. To all
these charges must be added the waiter’s fee of
one shilling or eighteenpence a head. ‘Sleeping on
the road’ absolved you from some of these costs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
but it was expensive in its own way. It involved
tea or supper, chambermaid and boots, as well as
bed and breakfast. Breakfast, with ham and eggs,
three shillings; tea, with a few slices of thin
bread-and-butter, eighteenpence or two shillings;
a soda and brandy, eighteenpence.</p>

<p>“Once, in the depth of winter, I left Bramham
Park, the seat of George Lane-Fox, on the Great
North Road, to proceed to London, with a journey
before me of 190 miles. I was well wrapped up,
with enough straw round my feet to conceal a
covey of partridges; still, after going about 37
miles, I felt myself so benumbed that I began
to think whether it would be wise to go on, or
get off and sacrifice my fare to London. Upon
reaching Bawtry I felt more comfortable, the
guard at Doncaster having lent me a tarpaulin
lined with sheepskin; so I resolutely determined
to brave the pitiless storm of snow, now whitening
the ground.</p>

<p>“‘Half an hour for supper,’ exclaimed the
waiter, as we pulled up at the ‘Crown.’ Down
I got, entered the room, where there was a bright
fire blazing, devoured some cold beef, drank a
glass of hot brandy-and-water, and bravely went
forth to face the elements. By this time the snow
had increased, the wind had got up, and my heart
failed. Back I rushed to the bar, ordered a bed,
and remained there for the night, finishing my
journey the following day.</p>

<p>“Again, in coming from Bath by a night coach,
I was so saturated with wet and shivering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
with cold that I got out at Reading, rushed to
the ‘Bear,’ and slept there the night.”</p>

<p>Such was the best travelling that money could
buy in the days before England was—according
to the coachmen—made a gridiron by the
railways.</p>

<span class="subhead">SNOW AND FLOODS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Severe</span> weather, in the shape of frosts, thunderstorms,
or hurricanes, was powerless to stop the
coach-service, but exceptionally heavy snowfalls
occasionally did succeed in doing so for very brief
intervals; and floods, although they never were or
could be so general as to wholly suspend coaching,
often brought individual coaches to grief.</p>

<p>In the severe winter of 1798–9, when snow
fell heavily and continuously at the end of
January and during the first week of February,
several mails, missing on February 1st, were still
to seek on April 27th, and St. Martin’s-le-Grand
mourned them as wholly lost. By May Day,
however, they did succeed in running again!</p>

<p>Very few details survive of that exceptional
season, or of that other, in 1806, when Nevill, a
guard on the Bristol Mail, was frozen to death;
but the records of the great snowstorm that began
on the Christmas night of 1836 are very full.</p>

<p>Christmas Day, 1836, fell on a Sunday, and it
is worth notice, as a singular coincidence in this
country of only occasional heavy snowfalls, that
the Christmas night of 1886, also a Sunday night,
exactly half a century later, was marked by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
well-remembered snowstorm which disorganised
the railway service quite as effectually as that
of 1836 did the coaches, and broke down and
destroyed nearly every telegraph-post and wire
in the land.</p>

<p>The famous snowstorm of 1836 affected all
parts of the country, and only on two mail routes
were communications kept open. Fourteen mail-coaches
were abandoned on the various roads,
and for periods ranging from two to ten days
the travels of others ceased. The snowstorm itself
continued for nearly a week. The two routes
remaining unconquered during this extraordinary
time were those to Portsmouth and Poole, but
precisely why or how they were thus distinguished
is not made clear. There is no doubt that the
coachmen and guards on the Portsmouth and
Poole Mails were strenuous men, but that quality
was common to many of those engaged upon the
mails. Nor can we find any favouring circumstance
of physical geography to account for this
unusual good fortune. On the contrary, those
roads are in places exceptionally bleak and exposed
to high winds; and the strong wind that
on this occasion bared the heights and buried
the hollows twenty and thirty feet deep in snow-wreaths
was an especial feature of the visitation.
Fortunately for all upon the roads—for those who
laboured along them, and for those who were
brought to a standstill in the drifts—the cold
was not remarkably severe.</p>

<p>But never before, within living recollection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
had the London mails been stopped for a whole
night within a few miles from London, and never
before had the intercourse between the South
Coast and the Metropolis been interrupted for
two whole days. On Chatham Lines the snow
lay from thirty to forty feet deep, and everywhere,
except on the hilltops, it was higher than the
roofs of the coaches. Nay, according to a contemporary
newspaper account, “The snow has
drifted to such an extent between Leicester and
Northampton as to occasion considerable difficulty
and danger. In some parts of the road passages
have been cut where the snow had drifted to
the depth of thirty, forty, and in some places
fifty feet.”</p>

<p>The great difficulty with which the coaches
had on this occasion to contend was not merely
the getting along the roads, but, as with these
extraordinary depths of snow the natural features
of the country were mostly obscured, of keeping
on or anywhere near the road. Hedgerows were
blotted out of existence: many trees had fallen
under their snowy burdens, and it was not
unusual, when at last the snowed-up mails were
recovered, to find them strayed far from their
course, and in the middle of pastures and
ploughlands.</p>

<p>Snowstorms produced curious travelling experiences.
It was this great occasion that
effectually blocked all the up night coaches for
two days at Dunchurch, on the Holyhead Road,
and so succeeded in bringing together a party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
not unlike those weatherbound travellers who in
Dickens’ Christmas stories gather round the
hearth, and, comforting themselves with many
jorums of punch, tell dramatic stories. One party
crowded the “Dun Cow,” another the “Green
Man.” Among the coaches were the Manchester
“Beehive” and the “Red Rover.” The first
morning of their enforced leisure they—coachmen,
guards and passengers—made up a poaching
party, with two guns among sixteen of them.
Jack Goodwin, guard of the “Beehive,” was the
only fortunate sportsman, and shot a hare. In
the evening a dancing party was held at the
“Dun Cow” at the suggestion of the landlord,
who invited some friends, and the next morning
Goodwin turned wandering minstrel, taking with
him a chosen few to help in chorus. Wandering
along the Rugby Road, they were entertained at
the farmhouses with elderberry wine and pork
pies. Another pleasant evening, and they were
off the next morning for London.</p>

<p>Floods were infinitely more dangerous than
snowstorms, and the Great North Road, between
Newark-on-Trent and Scarthing Moor, was particularly
subject to them, the Trent often, and
on the very slightest provocation of rain, flooding
many miles of surrounding country. It was here,
and on these occasions, that the outsides had the
better bargain of the two classes of travelling, for
they kept their seats without fear of being drowned,
while the insides went in constant terror of a
watery death, and often only escaped it by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163<br /><a id="Page_164">164</a><br /><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
pitiful expedient of standing on their seats and so—keeping
the doubled-up attitude this necessity
and the lowness of the roof imperatively demanded—remaining
until the levels were passed and the
dry uplands reached again.</p>

<p>In August 1829, when extraordinary floods
devastated a great part of Scotland, a stirring
episode occurred in connection with them and the
mail-coach running through Banff. The tradition
that his Majesty’s mails were to be stopped for
nobody and hindered by nothing on the road was
a very fine and fearless one, but it was occasionally
pushed to absurd lengths, and hideous dangers
provoked without reasonable cause. This episode
of the Banff and Inverness Mail is a case in point.
The mail of the preceding day had found it impracticable
to go by its usual route, and so took
another course, by the Bridge of Alva. It was
therefore supposed that the mail following would
adopt the same plan; but what was the astonishment
of the good folk of Banff when they perceived
the coach arrive, within a few minutes of its usual
time, at the farther end of the bridge that crosses
the River Dovern. The people, watching the
eddying floods from the safe vantage-point of their
windows, strongly dissuaded the guard and coachman
from attempting to pass, the danger being
so great; but, scouting the idea of perils to be
encountered in the very streets of the town, those
foolhardy persons drove straight along the bridge
and into a street that had been converted by the
bursting of the river-bank into the semblance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
a mountain torrent. When the furious current
caught the coach, it was instantly dashed against
the corner of Gillan’s Inn, and the four animals
swept off their legs. They rose again, plunging
and struggling for their lives, and a boat was
pushed off, with men eager to free the poor animals
from their harness, to enable them to swim away;
but it was not possible to save more than one.
The other three were drowned.</p>

<p>By this time the coach, with coachman and
guard, had been flung upon the pavement, where
the depth of water was less; and there the guard
was seen, clinging to the top, and the coachman
hanging by his hands from a lamp-post, regretting
too late the official ardour and slavery to tradition
that had wrought such havoc. When, for
humanity’s sake, as well as to secure the mail-bags,
a boat came and rescued them, they were
not suffered to depart without much Aberdonian
plain-speaking on the folly that had nearly cost
them their lives and endangered the correspondence
of the good folks of the ancient burgh
of Banff.</p>

  <div class="caption vtight"><p><span class="in4">MAIL-COACH IN A SNOW-DRIFT.</span>
<span class="fright"><i>After J. Pollard.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>There were no passengers on this occasion, but
we are not to suppose that, had there been any,
they would have received much consideration.
The mail would probably have been driven on,
just the same. The official attitude of mind
towards them may be judged from the wintry
horrors encountered by the Edinburgh to Glasgow
Mail in March 1827. It became embedded in the
snow near Kirkliston, and the guard, riding one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167<br /><a id="Page_168">168</a><br /><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
horse and leading another loaded with the bags,
set off for Glasgow; while the coachman, with the
other horses, set off in the opposite direction to
secure a fresh team, pursued by the entreaties of
the four terrified passengers, beseeching him to
use all diligence and return soon. There, on a
lonely road, immovably stuck in huge snowdrifts,
they remained throughout a bitter night, made
additionally miserable by one of the windows being
broken. It was not until nine o’clock the next
morning that the coachman returned, with another
man, but only two horses. Having loaded them
with some luggage and parcels, he was, with a
joke upon his lips, leaving the passengers to shift
for themselves, but was compelled to take one
who had fallen ill. The remaining three extricated
themselves as best they could.</p>

<p>On September 11th, 1829, a month later than
the watery adventures at Banff, the Birmingham
and Liverpool Mail had an unfortunate experience
at Smallwood Bridge, near Church Lawton, a point
where the road is crossed by an affluent of the
River Weaver. Unknown to those on the mail,
the flooded stream had burst the arch of the
bridge, and when the coach came to the spot,
along a road almost axle-deep in water, it fell into
the hole and was violently overturned. Of the
three inside passengers, only one escaped. He
was an agile young man, who broke the window
and so extricated himself. The horses were
drowned, but the coachman was fortunate enough
to be washed against a tree-stump as the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
hurried him along at six miles an hour. The
force of this happy meeting nearly stunned him,
but he held on, and eventually found his way
ashore. The guard was saved in a similar manner.
Accidents almost forming parallels with this were
of frequent occurrence, and a seasoned traveller
exclaimed: “Give me a collision, a broken axle
and an overturn, a runaway team, a drunken
coachman, snowstorms, howling tempests; but
Heaven preserve us from floods!”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GOLDEN AGE, 1824–1848</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">It</span> was “golden” chiefly from the sportsman’s
point of view, and in the opinions of those who
found a keen delight in the perfection of coach-building
and harness-making, in the smartness of
the beautiful horses, and in the speed attained.
From the sordid view-point of the profit-and-loss
account, although this was the age in which
Chaplin and a few others made their great fortunes,
it was a time when the high speed and
other refinements of travelling made the path
of the coach-proprietor a thorny and uneasy one,
often barren of aught but honour. “You are
‘in it,’ I see,” said a proprietor who himself
had been severely bitten in this way, and had
left the business, to a coachman who, like many
of his fellows, had long cherished an ambition
to become a coach-master, and had just acquired
a share: “you are ‘in it.’ Take care how you
get out of it.” One of the prominent men in
it—Cooper, who ran a good line of coaches on
the Bath Road—found himself at last in the
Bankruptcy Court, and many smaller men appeared
in the same place. The greatest increase
of cost was in the item of horses. In earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
times the stock had lasted for years, despite the
long stages and harder pulling; but in this period
of good roads and short stages, when, all things
being equal, a team should have lasted longer,
the great coach-proprietors found it necessary to
renew their stock every three years. Chaplin’s
method of doing this was to replace one-third
of his horses every year.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the horses thus
disposed of were always broken down or worn
out by their three years of strenuous exertion
in the fast coaches. They had only lost those
agile qualities necessary for that use, and, finding
purchasers among farmers and country tradesmen
who had no occasion to gallop at eleven miles
an hour, lived very comfortably, grew sleek and
fat, and must often, from roadside paddocks, have
beheld their successors slaving away in the fast
coaches; finding much satisfaction in their own
altered circumstances. Coachmen at this time
usually drove between thirty and forty miles out,
and then took the up coach back, perhaps more
than half a day later. With such an arrangement
the horses had the same driver, and it was
generally found that they worked much better
in such cases. The coachman’s responsibility for
their condition was also undivided, and the proprietor
was easily able to weed out from his
coachmen those who lingered at the changes and
made up the lost time on the road, to the distress
of their teams. It was Chaplin who made it
known, by all the vigorous language at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
command, that any one of his coachmen found
in the possession of one of those instruments of
torture, resembling a cat-o’-nine-tails, for punishing
horses, and known as a “short Tommy”
would be instantly dismissed. Chaplin’s direct
influence and interests may be said to have
described a radius of from forty to fifty miles
from London, and within that circle the “short
Tommy” was therefore but seldom seen. One
historic occasion there was, however, when such
an object did most dramatically present itself
before Chaplin, who chanced to be at a wayside
inn when one of his coaches pulled up to change.
On the roof was a warder with two convicts.
As the coachman, with much deliberation, lowered
himself from his box to the ground, the “short
Tommy” he had been sitting on fell in front
of the windows, and as it lay there attracted
the eagle eye of that great coach-proprietor, who,
sternly bent upon executing justice upon the
offender, strode forth. The coachman, dismayed,
saw his employer and the forbidden instrument
at once, in one comprehensive, understanding
gaze; but he was a resourceful man, and handed
it to the warder, telling him, with a portentous
wink and a warning jerk of the head, that he
had dropped something. That worthy, entering
into the spirit of the deception, accepted the
pretended cat-o’-nine-tails, and the coachman
breathed freely again.</p>

<p>The days of ten- or eleven mile- stages, just
at this time faded away, gave a horse one stretch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
of so many miles a day; but in the fast coaches
of the newer age they ran, as we have seen, out
and home, six or seven miles each way. It was
to the very last a disputed point whether it
was better for a horse to do his ten or eleven
miles and have done with it for the day, or to
do his two shifts of six or seven. Many coachmen
who could not depend upon their horsekeepers
objected to two sweats a day; but this
division of work was a decided advantage to the
horses, if well tended, and in such cases they
had the advantage of sleeping at home every
night. The number of horses kept for one of
the fast coaches of this Augustan age would
have astonished the pioneers of coaching; one
horse for every mile travelled was the establishment
kept up. Slow coaches could do with fewer.</p>

<p>The average price paid for a coach-horse at
this period was £30, but some were acquired for
a mere trifle, owing to their being vicious or
unmanageable in private hands. The private
owner’s dilemma was the coach-proprietor’s opportunity.
It mattered little to him what defects
of temper a horse possessed so long as he was
sound in wind and limb. For the rest, a little
discipline, harnessed with three others, all subject
to the rule of those very able disciplinarians, the
coachmen, quickly sufficed to bring such an
animal to reason. There were thus some very
queer animals drawing the coaches in these last
years.</p>

<p>Some were purchased with a doubtful title.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
In such a case, to prevent his being recognised
and claimed, the horse would be worked on the
night mail.</p>

<p>The coachman’s ideal was a team matching
in colour, but few proprietors ever aimed at such
perfection. The cost was great, and nothing, save
the gratification of the eye, was gained.</p>

<p>With these business details the travelling
public had no concern, and it was only the box-seat
passengers who learnt the history of some of
these cheap acquisitions from private stables. The
box-seat passenger was generally a sporting
character, aspiring to that companionship with
the coachman from his love of horses and driving,
but it naturally often happened that some stolid
person, whose only desire was to be carried safely
and who took no interest in driving, found himself
perched on that place of honour. When such an
one became the unwilling confidant of the coachman
he was apt to hear some nerve-shaking
things. “See that ’ere near wheeler?” said one
Jehu. “Run avay vith a old gennelman last
veek, he did; broke his neck; friends just goin’
to shoot ’im; guv’nor gave couple o’ suvrings
for ’im, and ’ere ’e is. ’Ope we shan’t be upset!”
The nervous passenger effected an exchange for
an inside place with a sporting passenger at the
next stage—which was precisely the result anticipated
by the coachman.</p>

<p>At this time, when the fast day-coaches were
in every respect as well-appointed as a gentleman’s
private drag, it was the keenest ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
of every dashing young traveller to occupy this
box-seat—an ambition generally satisfied by putting
in an early appearance at the starting-point
and tipping the head yard-porter, who thereupon
placed a rug or some stable-cloths on it. These
tips were not, as generally supposed, the coachman’s
perquisite. His turn came later on, down
the road.</p>

<p>The yard-porter was as a much more important
official than the present generation might suppose,
and in busy yards, such as those of the “Bull
and Mouth” or the “Swan with Two Necks,”
his weekly income from tips probably amounted
to £5, or more. Nor was he merely the man
with a pail of water, a broom and a pitchfork
conjured up mentally by the sound of his title;
his was an important department, and himself
the ruler of many subordinates, whose duties
ranged from grooming and bedding-down the
horses and cleaning the stables to washing the
coaches and cleaning and polishing the harness
and metal-work.</p>

<p>At this period the public found themselves
swiftly flying where they had formerly slowly
and laboriously crawled, and generally compared
ancient travelling with modern, greatly to the
advantage of modern times. But if the coach-proprietors
who were at such pains to compete
with one another in establishing these swift and
well-appointed coaches were of opinion that in
so doing they were earning the admiration of
the entire travelling public, they were very soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
undeceived, and those weaker brethren who could
not command the influence and the capital by
which only could a fast coach be appointed
and established, found that, after all, there was
no immediate prospect of their being run off the
road, and that a considerable section of the public
actually preferred to travel in slow coaches, and
would by no means consent to be whirled through
the country at eleven miles an hour, with only
hurried intervals for meals. “The art of travelling,”
said an anonymous writer in 1827, “has undergone
great alterations in the course of the last thirty
years; these are not altogether improvements.”
One of these changes for the worse, in the opinion
of this unknown scribe, was that in the thunder
of ten miles an hour there was no opportunity
for conversation. That must be a powerful tongue,
he thought, which could make itself heard amid
the reverberations of such incessant and intemperate
whirlings. He could not help looking back
with some regret to the good old times when
five or six miles an hour was the utmost speed.
<em>Then</em> there was something sober and sedate in
the fit-out and the set-out. All the faces in the
inner-yard were so grave and full of importance,
and there was some seriousness in taking leave.
(Good reason, too, for such gravity and seriousness,
think we of later ages.) How scrupulous and
polite were the inside passengers, in making
mutual accommodation of legs and arms, band-boxes,
sandwich-baskets and umbrellas! Then,
too, says this delightful snob, there was some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
difference between the inside and the outside
passengers: the gentlefolks within were not
confounded with the people on the outside.
Distinctions were then better observed, and
preserved. Older stage-coach conversation, he
continued, was apt to be conducted with caution,
for a false opening might make an ill companion
on a long journey. So approaches were made
skilfully, and with deliberation. A man was
thought excessively forward and talkative if
he had got into politics before he had well
cleared the outskirts of London, and the first
half-hour was generally occupied with the light
skirmishings of talk, with reconnoitrings of one’s
opposite neighbour’s countenance, and a variety
of all-round questions and answers put and
returned merely to ascertain how far the passengers
were to be companions. These had to be framed
with the utmost discretion. With what vivacity
and air of pleasant expectation would one then
ask an agreeable-looking person, “Are you going
all the way to Toppington?” or, on the other
hand, if the inside had its full complement of
six, how carefully, and with what a discreetly
modulated voice, in order to avoid all suspicion
of wishing a speedy riddance, one would ask
the same question of an unduly stout person, who
occupied much more than his or her share of room.</p>

<p>The best conversational opening was considered
to be, “Well, we are now off the stones. What a
beautiful morning! How charming the outskirts
of town! Pray, does not that house belong to——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Going up-hill one walked, to ease the horses,
insides and outsides then equal; the insides,
greatly condescending, holding converse with the
occupants of the roof, always, however, with the
strict understanding—no less strict if not mentioned—that
this gracious act must not be taken advantage
of by those outsiders claiming acquaintance
when the coach stopped at the inns, where this
all-important difference in caste was recognised
by distinct eating apartments being provided.</p>

<p>Those were the good old days, according to
this critic, when these customs were strictly
observed, and when there was not only time to
eat, but almost to digest at coach-dinners and
breakfasts; when, too, there were generally a
few minutes to spare while the horses were being
got ready, so that the passengers could wander
round the town and copy any curious epitaphs
for the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, or do a little
shopping.</p>

<p>Coachmen were of somewhat similar opinions.
“Lord! sir,” said Hine, coach-proprietor and
coachman on the Brighton Road, in 1831, who
was, much against his will, obliged to accelerate
his coaches in order to keep pace with newcomers,
but did not relish the necessity, “we don’t travel
half so comfortably now as we used to do. It
is all hurry and bustle nowadays, sir—no time
even for a pipe and glass of grog.” Not comfortable
for the coachmen, who sadly missed their
wayside, and often wholly unauthorised, halts.</p>

<p>Cobbett, surly though his nature was, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
not withhold admiration when noticing these
latter-day coaches. “Next to a fox-hunt,” he
says, “the finest sight in England is a stage-coach
just ready to start. A great sheep- or cattle-fair
is a beautiful sight; but in a stage-coach you
see more of what man is capable of performing.
The vehicle itself; the harness, all so complete
and so neatly arranged, so strong, and clean,
and good; the beautiful horses, impatient to be
off; the inside full, and the outside covered, in
every part, with men, women, and children,
boxes, bags, bundles; the coachman, taking his
reins in one hand and his whip in the other,
gives a signal with his foot, and away they go,
at the rate of seven miles an hour—the population
and the property of a hamlet. One of these
coaches coming in, after a long journey, is a
sight not less interesting. The horses are now
all sweat and foam, the reek from their bodies
ascending like a cloud. The whole equipage is
covered, perhaps, with dust and dirt. But still,
on it comes, as steady as the hand of the clock.
As a proof of the perfection to which this mode
of travelling has been brought, there is one coach
which goes between Exeter and London, whose
proprietors agree to forfeit eightpence for every
minute the coach is behind its time at any of
its stages; and this coach, I believe, travels eight
miles an hour, and that, too, upon a very hilly,
and at some seasons a very deep, road.”</p>

<p>Yes, but had Cobbett written in still later
years, he would have found the “Quicksilver”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183<br /><a id="Page_184">184</a><br /><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
attaining, between the stages, a speed of nearly
12 miles an hour, and an average speed,
including stops, of 11 miles, while a quite
ordinary performance with the Shrewsbury
“Wonder” was 158 miles in 14 hours 45 minutes,
including stops on the way totalling 80 minutes.
This gives a net average speed of a little over
11½ miles an hour. The Manchester “Telegraph”
and other flyers made equally good
performances. The “Tantivy,” one of the most
famous of coaches, did not equal these feats.</p>

<p>The “Tantivy,” London and Birmingham
coach, was started in 1832. It left the “Blossoms”
inn, Lawrence Lane, at 7 a.m., and was in
Birmingham by 7 p.m. The distance, by the
route followed, through Maidenhead, Henley,
Oxford, Woodstock, Shipston-on-Stour, and Stratford-on-Avon,
was 125 miles, and, deducting one
hour for changing and refreshing, the speed was
only slightly over 11 miles an hour. This coach
derived its name from the old word “Tantivy”—an
imitative sound as old as the seventeenth
century, and often used in the literature of that
time, supposed to reproduce the note of the
huntsman’s horn, and conjuring up ideas of
speed. For Cracknell, the most famous of the
coachmen of the “Tantivy,” who once drove the
125 miles at one sitting, and generally drove
it between London and Oxford, the “Tantivy
Trot,” quoted elsewhere in these pages, was
written. Harry Salisbury drove between Oxford
and Birmingham. Among its other coachmen was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Jerry Howse. Costar and Waddell, of Oxford,
horsed the “Tantivy” between Woodstock and
London, and Gardner, of Stratford-on-Avon, part-horsed
it onwards, not wholly to the satisfaction
of Salisbury, who used to declare that the team
out of his yard was worth about £25 the lot,
and that they had once belonged to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Competition in speed led naturally to rivalry
in the building, upholstering, and general appointments
of the coaches. Sherman’s Manchester
“Estafette” was a splendid turn-out, holding
its own against many rivals in the last years
of the coaching age. Inside was a time-table
elegantly engraved on ivory, showing all towns,
distances and intermediate times, illuminated
at night by a reflector lamp. It was at this
time seriously proposed to light the coaches with
gas, with the double object of securing better
lighting and effecting a saving on the very heavy
bills for oil consumed on the night coaches. The
idea was generally abandoned when it was found
that the gas tanks would be very heavy and that
they would take up all the room in one of the
boots, generally reserved for luggage. Coachmen
and guards, too, professed anxiety lest they,
sitting directly over the fore and hind boots,
should be blown up. But, before the project
was finally abandoned, it was fully proved that
it was practicable, and in January 1827 the
Glasgow and Paisley coaches were lit with gas,
much to the amazement of the country folk.
“Guid Lord, Sandy,” said an old woman to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
husband, “they’ve laid gas-pipes all the way
frae Glasgae Cross to Paisley!” But they had
done nothing of the sort; the gas was carried, as
already indicated, in a reservoir stowed away in
the front boot.</p>

<p>Competition having already raged around the
question of speed, and having introduced unwonted
luxuries in travelling, turned next to
the more deadly form of rate-cutting. In 1834
the coach-proprietors on three great routes were
engaged in this game of Beggar-my-neighbour.
In that year the fares to Birmingham, Liverpool,
and Manchester fell to less than half their former
price, and it was possible to travel to Birmingham
for 20<i>s.</i> inside and 10<i>s.</i> out, or to Liverpool or
Manchester for 40<i>s.</i> inside or 20<i>s.</i> out. They had
little chance of being raised again, for, by the
time the weaker men had been crushed out of
existence, the railways were threatening the
whole industry of coaching.</p>

<p>But reducing the fares by one-half was not
always the last word in these bitter contests.
There was a period on the Brighton Road when
one might have been carried those 52 miles in
6 hours for 5<i>s.</i>, with a free lunch and wine at
the end of the journey and your money returned
if the coach did not keep its time. The “Golden
Age,” indeed!</p>

<p>At this period, when the long-distance coaching
business was so severely cut up, those proprietors
who served the districts surrounding London did exceedingly
well. Coaching annals are almost silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
on the subject of these suburban coaches, for,
being drawn by only two horses, they were
regarded by the four-in-hand artists with contempt.
It has thus, in the absence of available information,
often puzzled inquiring minds in the present
generation to understand how the heavy passenger
traffic was conducted between London and the outlying
towns and villages within a radius of twenty
miles. Those districts were served by these “short
stages,” as they were called—coaches drawn by two
horses, and making two or more journeys each
way daily. There was an incredibly large number
of these useful vehicles, which were in relation to
the mails and fast long-distance coaches what the
suburban trains are to the expresses in our own
day. The ordinary coach-proprietors had rarely
anything to do with these conveyances, which came
to and set out from a number of obscure inns and
coach-offices in all parts of the City and the West
End.</p>

<p>One of these short stages is mentioned in
<i>David Copperfield</i>, where David’s page-boy,
stealing Dora’s watch and selling it, purchases a
second-hand flute and expends the balance of his
ill-gotten gains in incessantly travelling up and
down the road between London and Uxbridge.
Evidently a lover of the road, this larcenous page-boy.
Most boys in buttons (and certainly the
typical page-boy of the typical farce) would have
expended the plunder in pastry or tobacco. This
particular specimen, the diligent Dickens-reader
will remember, was taken to Bow Street on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
completion of his fifteenth journey, when four
shillings and sixpence and the second-hand flute—which
he couldn’t play—were found upon him.
If we were contemplating an examination-paper
on <i>David Copperfield</i>, with special reference to
prices and social life early in the nineteenth
century, we might put the following poser:—“State
the average price obtainable on the
average lady’s gold watch, and, deducting the
purchase price of a second-hand flute, deduce
from the resulting sum, and from the facts of the
boy having made the journey fifteen times and
still being in possession of four-and-sixpence, the
cost of a single outside journey between London
and Uxbridge.”</p>

<p>The fare was, as a matter of fact, half a crown.
There were no fewer than seven short stages
between London and Uxbridge daily, each making
two journeys. What of those London inns whence
they started? Where are they now? Echo does
not answer “where?” as she is commonly said to
do, because it is not in the nature of echoes to
repeat the first word of a sentence. No; echo
merely reverberates “now?” with a questioning
inflection.</p>

<p>The “Goose and Gridiron,” whose proper name
was originally the “Swan and Harp,” in St. Paul’s
Churchyard, was one of these starting-points.
From the same inn went the Richmond and many
other suburban stages. That old inn was demolished
about 1888. The “Boar and Castle and
Oxford Hotel,” No. 6, Oxford Street, was another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
house of call for the Uxbridge stages. It vanished
long ago, and those who seek it will only find on
its site the Oxford Music Hall and Restaurant—bearing
a different number, for the street was renumbered
in 1881. The “Boar and Castle” was a
large, plain, stucco-fronted house, with its name
writ large across the front in raised letters.</p>

<p>As for the “Old Bell,” another of these starting-points
of the Uxbridge coaches, it was pulled
down in 1897. It stood on the site of Gamage’s,
in Holborn, opposite Fetter Lane. Of another
Uxbridge house, the “Bull,” a few doors away,
the sign, the figure of a ferocious black bull, very
properly chained and fastened by a secure girth,
still exists on the frontage, but “Black Bull
Chambers,” a set of grimy modern “model”
dwellings, now occupy the coach-yard. The “Bell
and Crown,” afterwards “Ridler’s,” next Furnival’s
Inn, has been swept away to help make room for
an extension of the Prudential Assurance Offices,
and the “New Inn,” 52, Old Bailey, has given
place to warehouses and the premises of a firm
of wholesale newsagents. Away westward, the
Uxbridge and other short stages called at the
“Green Man and Still,” at the corner of Argyll
Street, Oxford Circus, and at the “Gloucester
Warehouse,” near Park Lane. The last-named
was rebuilt forty years ago, but the “Green Man
and Still” was only demolished in February 1901.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After J. Pollard.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The time taken over the eighteen miles
between the City and Uxbridge was three hours.
To Richmond in 1821, when short stages ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191<br /><a id="Page_192">192</a><br /><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
frequently from five different inns, the time was
an hour and a half. As many as fourteen coaches
ran to that town in 1838, most of them making
six journeys a day. Shillibeer and his omnibuses,
introduced in 1829, had by that time rendered the
exclusive short-stages old-fashioned, and they
were gradually replaced by the more commodious
and popular vehicles, whose occupants were in turn
looked down upon by the short-stage passengers,
just as <em>they</em> had been despised by the four-horse
coaches.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">None</span> among the servants of the public earned
their living more hardly, or took greater risks in
the ordinary way of business, than the coach proprietors.
It was a business in which the few—the
very few—became rich, and the majority lived
a strenuous life, with empty pockets at the end
of it. It was very truly said of them, as a class,
that they lived hard, worked hard, swore hard,
and died hard. To this was sometimes added
that they held hard, by which you are to understand
that what money they <em>did</em> succeed in getting
they grasped tightly. This last was, however, by
no means a characteristic of the majority, who
very often dissipated what they had made by
successful ventures on one road by disastrous
competition on another. There was never a more
speculative business than that of a coach-proprietor,
and never one so cursed with insane
competition. Why embittered rivalries of this
kind should have been more common on the road
than in any other line is only to be explained by
the hypothesis that a certain element of sporting
emulation entered into it; and a kind of foolish
pride that impelled a man to put and keep a line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
of coaches on a road to “nurse” a rival, not
always with the hope of earning a profit for
himself, but with the idea of cutting up another
man’s ground.</p>

<p>The most outstanding figure among coach-proprietors
was that of William Chaplin. He
towered above all his contemporaries in the
magnitude of his business, and was, when railways
came to destroy it, first among those few
who saw the folly of opposing steam, and were
both acute enough and sufficiently fortunate to
reap an additional advantage from the new order
of things, instead of being ruined by it, as many
less fortunate and less far-seeing men were.</p>

  <div class="caption smaller">MAIL-COACH HALFPENNY ISSUED BY WILLIAM
WATERHOUSE.</div></div>

<p>William James Chaplin—to give him his full
baptismal name—was born at Rochester in 1787,
the son of William Chaplin, at that time a coachman
and proprietor in a small way of business
on the Dover Road. Shortly after that date it
would appear that the elder Chaplin extended
his operations, and became a coach-master on a
considerable scale on some of the main roads
leading out of London. However that may have
been, certain it is that his son was a practical
coachman, and thoroughly versed in every detail
of driving and stabling, as well as buying horses.
To this intimate acquaintance with the conduct
of a coach and of a coaching business, as greatly
as to his own native shrewdness, he owed the
extraordinary success that attended him. His
centre of operations was at the “Swan with Two
Necks,” in Lad Lane, where he succeeded William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Waterhouse, who had been established there as
a mail-contractor since 1792. He it was who,
perhaps in imitation of the Mail-coach Halfpenny
dedicated to Palmer, issued the curious copper
token pictured here. It is quite in accord with
the general fragmentary character of the records
of these not so remote times that nothing survives
by which we may state the year when Chaplin
succeeded Waterhouse at the “Swan with Two
Necks,” but it was probably about 1825. In
addition to this yard, he acquired in the course
of time those of the “White Horse,” Fetter Lane,
and the “Spread Eagle” and “Cross Keys,”
Gracechurch Street, together with the “Spread
Eagle” West End office, in Regent’s Circus, with
the proprietorship of several hotels. Unlike most
coach-proprietors, who restricted their operations
to one or two roads, Chaplin’s coaches went in
all directions, and he owned large stables at
Purley on the Brighton Road, at Hounslow on
the Western roads, and at Whetstone on the
great road to the north. The “Swan with Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197<br /><a id="Page_198">198</a><br /><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Necks,” was, when he acquired it, a yard
extremely awkward of approach, being situated
in a narrow lane, and inside a low-browed entrance
that taxed the ingenuity of the coachmen to pass
without accident. Once inside, you were in one
of those old courtyards without which no old
coaching inn was complete. Three tiers of
galleries ran round three sides of the enclosed
square, which, from the creepers that were
trailed round the old carved wooden posts or
depended from the balusters, and from the flower-boxes
that decorated the windows, was a very
rustic-looking place. Chaplin had not long settled
himself here before he constructed underground
stables beneath this yard, where some two hundred
horses were stalled; but the place remained,
otherwise unaltered, until about 1856, when all
the buildings were demolished, and he set himself
to raise on their site the huge pile of
buildings that now fronts partly on to Gresham
Street and partly to Aldermanbury. It was one
of his last works, and was, of course, undertaken
long after the coaching age had become a thing
of the past, being, indeed, intended for the headquarters
of the carrying business that had in the
meantime come into existence. It is of somewhat
curious interest to note that, although the great
gloomy pile of unadorned brick bears not the
slightest resemblance to the ancient coaching
inn, yet a courtyard survives, and railway vans
manœuvre where of old the mails arrived or set
forth.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>From the painting by Frederick Newnham.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>In 1838, when his coaching business had
reached its full height, Chaplin owned or part-owned
no fewer than 68 coaches, with 1,800
horses. Twenty-seven mails left London every
night, and of these he horsed fourteen on the first
stages out of and into town. The annual returns
from his business were then put at half a million
sterling.</p>

<p>At this critical period he resided at an hotel
he owned and managed in the Adelphi, where
he worked literally day and night, supervising
the general affairs of his vast business, and yet
finding time for correcting details. Those coachmen
who thought themselves secure from observation
in the midst of all these extensive operations
wofully deceived themselves. They had to reckon
with one to whom every detail was familiar—who
had driven coaches himself, and was thoroughly
informed in the opportunities that existed
in the stables and on the road for cheating an
employer. He knew the measure of every corn-box,
and was cognisant of the “shouldering” of
fares and “swallowing” of passengers that continually
went on. For the guards thus to pocket
the short fares, not entering them on the way-bill,
afterwards sharing them with the coachman, was
a practice that went back to the very early days of
coaching, and not only lasted as long as coaching
itself, but survived in a somewhat, altered form
on omnibuses until the introduction, in recent
years, of tickets and the bell-punch. It would
have been impossible for coach-proprietors to end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201<br /><a id="Page_202">202</a><br /><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
this practice without raising the wages of their
servants, and thus they were obliged, so long as
the coachmen and the guards performed their
“shouldering” and “swallowing” discreetly, to
allow it to continue. The practice was, indeed,
a very lucrative one to those chartered peculators,
who made a great deal more out of it than they
would in the substitution of higher wages and a
better code of morals. Like the omnibus-proprietors
until recently, coach-masters were content
so long as their takings reached a certain average
sum, and it was only when they fell below that
figure, or when a fare was “shouldered” or a
passenger “swallowed” before their very eyes,
that trouble began. Chaplin could thus afford
to give the toast, as often he did give it, at festive
gatherings of coachmen and guards, “Success to
‘shouldering,’ but” (with a peculiar emphasis)
“do it well!”—or, in plainer speech, “don’t get
found out!”</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After G. S. Treguar.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Stories with Chaplin for a central figure were,
of course, plentiful down the road. Stable-folk
told how one of their kind, who had been requisitioning
the contents of the corn-bin to an
extravagant extent, going to it with sack and
lantern one night when all was still, lifting
the lid, found Chaplin himself snugly waiting
within, who promptly arose in his wrath, and,
to the accompaniment of a picturesquely lurid
eloquence of which he was an undoubted master,
dismissed him instanter. The fame of that exploit
must have saved Chaplin much in forage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Although in his after-career as Member of
Parliament he was a silent representative, he
could be eloquent in various ways. He had, as
already hinted, the direct and forcible method in
perfection, and yet could suit his style to all
requirements. Coachmen, indeed, found him
much more dangerous in his suave and polite
moments, and much preferred to be sworn at
and violently attacked, for his polite speeches
generally had a sting in their tail, and earned
him, among the brethren of the road, the descriptive,
if also disrespectful, nickname of “Billy
Bite-’em-Sly.”</p>

<p>The portrait of him shows a physiognomy
altogether unexpected, after hearing these tales.
One perceives rather a delicate and refined face
than that mentally pictured, and it is only in the
piercing eyes that his energy and determination
are clearly seen.</p>

<p>Chaplin’s coaches were easily to be distinguished
along the roads, not only by the device
of the “Swan with Two Necks” painted on them,
or later, in addition, by those of a “Spread Eagle,”
“Cross Keys,” or a “White Horse,” as those inns
came under his control, but by their colours,
which were red and black—black upper-quarters
and fore and hind boots, and red under-parts and
wheels.</p>

<p>His coaching business gave employment to two

<p>Chaplin horsed the quickest mails out of
London: the Devonport, the New Holyhead, the
Bristol, and five other West-country mails starting
from Piccadilly. Passengers who had booked
from his City offices were carried to this point
by omnibuses he established, and the mails were
conveyed, with the guards, in two-wheeled mail-carts
from the General Post Office. In the great
number of coaches he ran there were, of course,
included some of the very best. His were those
famous coaches, the Manchester “Defiance,” a
rival of Sherman’s even more famed Manchester
“Telegraph,” the Birmingham “Greyhound,” the
Cambridge “Telegraph,” Liverpool “Red Rover,”
Bristol “Emerald,” Cheltenham “Magnet,” and
many others doing their ten miles and more an
hour. He also had half-shares in the brilliant
“Tantivy,” London and Birmingham, the “Stamford
Regent,” the Southampton “Comet,” and
others.</p>

<p>The signs of the times, so patent to outsiders
from 1830 and onwards, but generally hid from
the vision of those most interested, were not
unheeded by this remarkably shrewd business
man, who, like his contemporary, Joseph Baxendale,
had the power of seeing things and the
possible future trend of affairs from an impersonal
and unprejudiced point of view. He, above all
other coach-proprietors, was deeply interested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the continuance of the old order of things, and it
would not have been remarkable had he brought
himself to the illogical conclusion that, because he
was so interested, the old order must, could, should
and would be maintained. Many other coach-proprietors
<em>did</em> arrive at such a conclusion, not,
of course, by process of reasoning, but by force of
being habitually engaged in a business that prejudiced
their minds against steam and machinery.
Their first instincts of scorn for anything that
should presume to replace the horse effectually
blinded them to the reality of the coming change.</p>

<p>Chaplin early decided that coaches must go,
and that the proper policy was to make allies of
the railways in early days, while they were not
so sure of their own success, and would be substantially
grateful for any helping hand. He and
Benjamin Worthy Horne agreed with the London
and Birmingham to be their very good friends in
this matter, and not only withdrew all competitive
coaches as the line advanced towards completion,
but aided the railway in those months when a gap
in the line between Denbigh Hall and Rugby cut
the train journey in two. Between those two
points their coaches filled the unwontedly humble
position of feeders and go-betweens to the railway.
The price of this amiable attitude was a share with
Pickford &amp; Co. in the goods and parcel cartage
agency for the line, to the exclusion of all others.
This monopoly, as Chaplin had foreseen, was an
initially valuable one, and certain to constantly
increase, side by side with the growing trade and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
mileage of the railway itself. He sold most of
his coaches—who were those rash persons, greatly
daring, who bought coaches in those last days?—and
realised everything except what was considered
necessary to start the new firm of Chaplin &amp;
Horne, carriers, and to carry on the branch
coach-services on routes not yet affected by the
rail. Having thus converted his fortune into
hard cash and deposited it for the time being
in the bank, the next consideration was what to
do with it. All the preconceived ideas of investment
were being uprooted, and railways, which
offered many chances to the capitalist, were not
in those times bracketed with Government securities
as safe. Even supposing railways in general
offered inducements, those were the days when
they were not merely unproved, but when few
had advanced beyond the point of obtaining their
Parliamentary powers. They were, in fact, little
but projects on paper. With these problems to
consider, Chaplin did a singular thing. Leaving
his fortune on deposit, he went away and utterly
secluded himself in Switzerland for six weeks, to
debate within himself this turning-point in a
career. He was now fifty-one years of age, and
might well have been content with what he had
accumulated, and with the prospects of the new
firm. With the advantages he had already secured
he could have enjoyed a leisured life; but he took
the decision to embark a large portion of his cash
in the London and Southampton Railway, then
under construction and very much under a cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of depreciation. He aimed at becoming a director
on that line, and had that desire speedily gratified,
being further appointed Deputy Chairman in 1839.
By 1843 he had succeeded to the chair, and, with
one interval, remained Chairman of what became
the London and South-Western Railway until
1858, when ill-health compelled his resignation.
He had the satisfaction of seeing his belief in the
future of that railway assured. He was also a
director of the Paris and Rouen, the Rouen and
Havre, and the Rhenish Railways; Sheriff of
London, 1845–6; a Member of Parliament for
Salisbury, 1847–57; in politics an advanced
Liberal. He died at his residence, 2, Hyde Park
Gardens, on April 24th, 1859, in his seventy-second
year, leaving property to the value of over half a
million sterling, including a quarter share in the
firm of Chaplin &amp; Horne. William Augustus
Chaplin, the eldest among his eight sons and six
daughters, succeeded him in the conduct of that
business, and died, also in his seventy-second year,
at Melton Mowbray, October 9th, 1896.</p>

<p>Benjamin Worthy Horne, whose chief place
of business was the “Golden Cross,” Charing
Cross, succeeded his father, William Horne, in
1828. William Horne, who was born in 1783,
was originally a painter, but followed that trade
only a few years after his apprenticeship had
expired. He had at an early age married Mary
Worthy, daughter of Benjamin Worthy, a wealthy
wheelwright in Old Street, and in 1804 his eldest
son, Benjamin Worthy Horne, was born. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211<br /><a id="Page_212">212</a><br /><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
marriage bringing him the command of some
capital, he entered into partnership with one
Roberts, a coach-proprietor established at the
“White Horse,” Fetter Lane. But the partnership
was dissolved at the expiration of twelve
months, when Horne, making a bold stroke,
purchased the “Golden Cross” of John Cross,
who, having acquired a large fortune after many
years in business there, was now retiring from it
and entering upon a series of rash speculations
which eventually ruined him and brought Thomas
Cross, his son, down to poverty from the assured
position of heir to that fortune, and thence to the
dramatic reverse of soliciting employment as a
coachman in the very yard his father once had
owned.</p>

<p>Established thus at the “Golden Cross,”
William Horne further developed the very fine
coaching business he had acquired, and added to
it the yards at the “Cross Keys,” Wood Street,
and the “George and Blue Boar,” Holborn,
together with an office at 41, Regent Circus.
He soon had seven hundred horses in work, and
was in the full tide of life and energy when he
died in 1828, at the early age of forty-five.
“His last journey,” says the obituary notice of
him, “was but a short distance—St. Margaret’s
churchyard, Westminster; and, as a man of
talent, his remains were placed within a few
feet of some of the greatest men of their age.”</p>

<p>Benjamin Worthy Horne was thus only
twenty-four years of age when the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
of this business fell to him. He soon had need
of all those fierce energies that were his, for, in
addition to a watchful eye upon the doings of
his rivals, he had the stress and turmoil of the
rebuilding of the “Golden Cross” to contend with.
To him, indeed, fell the singular experience of
having that central place of business rebuilt
twice in three years, and the second occasion on
another site. When it was first rebuilt, in 1830,
Trafalgar Square was not in existence, and the
inn was re-erected on the old spot at the rear
of Charles I.’s statue, exactly where the south-eastern
one of Landseer’s four lions, guarding
the Nelson Column, now looks across towards
the Grand Hotel.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the place rebuilt than
the Metropolitan improvements in the meanwhile
decided upon brought about the clearance of the
site, and the present “Golden Cross” arose some
distance away. At this time fifty-six coaches
left that place daily, many of them bitterly competitive
with those of other proprietors. Equally
with his father, Benjamin Horne was an extremely
keen business man, and eager to cut into any
paying route. He had stables at Barnet and
Finchley, to enable him to compete advantageously
on the northern and north-western roads with
Sherman, of the “Bull and Mouth,” and with
others on those routes. As early as 1823, when
the “Tally-Ho!” fast coach between London and
Birmingham was first put on the road by Mrs.
Ann Mountain, of the “Saracen’s Head,” Snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Hill, to do the 109 miles in 11 hours, the
success of her enterprise had roused the jealousy
of William Horne, who speedily started the
“Independent Tally-Ho!”—setting out an hour
and a quarter earlier, in order to intercept the
bookings of the original conveyance. Numerous
other “Tally-Ho’s!” were then established, and
the racing between them on the London and
Birmingham road grew fast and furious, much
to the advantage of the slower coaches, whose
bookings were wonderfully increased by timid
passengers refusing to go any longer by these
breakneck rivals.</p>

<p>Benjamin Worthy Horne had at one time
seven mails: the old Chester and Holyhead;
the Cambridge Auxiliary; the Gloucester and
Cheltenham; the Dover Foreign Mail; the Norwich,
through Newmarket; the Milford Haven;
and the Worcester and Oxford; in addition to the
Hastings, a two-horsed affair, afterwards transferred
to the “Bolt-in-Tun” office in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Urged on, perhaps, by the partial success of
the competitive “Tally-Ho!” he started in 1834,
in alliance with Robert Nelson of the “Belle
Sauvage” and Jobson of the “Talbot” at Shrewsbury,
the “Nimrod” London and Shrewsbury
coach, to compete with that pioneer of long-distance
day coaches the “Wonder,” a highly
successful venture established so early as 1825,
by Sherman of the “Bull and Mouth,” and Taylor
of the “Lion” at Shrewsbury. The bitterness
and bad blood thus stirred up were almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
incredible. It is not to be supposed that men
so spirited as Sherman and Isaac Taylor were
content to idly see this late-comer enter the field
their own enterprise had opened, and be allowed
to cut up their profits; and so the following
season witnessed the appearance of the “Stag,”
own sister to the “Wonder,” and by the same
proprietors, timed to run a little in advance of
the “Nimrod,” while the “Wonder” went slightly
in the rear. Thus the hated rival was pretty well
“nursed” all the way, and did not often succeed
in securing a well-filled way-bill. The pace while
this insane competition lasted was terrific, and
the coachman of the “Nimrod” on the Wolverhampton
and Shrewsbury stage was thrown off
and killed. The coaches were originally fast,
being timed at 11½ miles an hour; but in the
furious racing that took place, day after day,
the whole three often arrived together at the
journey’s end, two hours before time. One
shrinks from computing the pace an analysis of
these figures would disclose. The fares by the
“Wonder” and “Stag” were in the meanwhile
reduced by one-third; and, partly in consequence
of this “alarming sacrifice,” and a great deal
more, we may suppose, in consequence of travellers
being afraid to travel by these reckless
competitors, £1500 were lost by Sherman and
his allies in twelve months. But at the end of
that time they had the satisfaction of seeing
the “Nimrod” withdrawn, when the fares were
raised to their old level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
We are not told how much Horne and his
friends lost in this onslaught upon Sherman’s
preserves, but it must have been a very considerable
sum. Horne ran in opposition to many
proprietors, and was powerful enough to wear
down any competitors except the three or four
men whose businesses ranked with his own for
size. Those proprietors who agreed to work
with rather than against him, were therefore
the better advised. When putting a new coach
on a route, his practice was to offer a share in
the business to others accustomed to work along
it. If they refused, and elected to oppose him,
he became dangerous. He never allowed competition;
and as he had the longer purse, generally
beat his rivals. A strictly businesslike proprietor
would accordingly always welcome Horne as a
partner; but it generally happened that men who
had for years past run coaches on certain roads
fell unconsciously into the habit of thinking and
acting as though they held a prescriptive right
to the whole of the traffic along them, and not
only refused to ally themselves with any one
providing additional coaches, but endeavoured to
shut him out altogether. Thus Horne, although
ready to work with any proprietor, was in bitter
opposition on many roads.</p>

<p>His was the Liverpool “Umpire,” a day
coach; and his, too, the “Bedford Times,” so
far as horsing it out of London was concerned.
It was started about 1836, by Whitbread, the
brewer, as a hobby, and ran from the “George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
and Blue Boar.” It is singular that it made
the third Bedford coach running daily from
that inn: Horne seems to have considered that
Bedford could not have too many coaches. The
others were the “Telegraph,” twice a day—8 a.m.
and 2.45 p.m.—and the “Royal Telegraph” at
9 a.m. The “Times” started at 3 p.m., and
went at 10½ miles an hour, including stops. This
was a very smart and exclusive coach, built on
the lines of the private drag, and ran to that
monumental Bedford hotel, the “Swan.” The
“Bedford Times” was further remarkable as one
of the last-surviving of the coaches. It was not
run off the road until 1848.</p>

<p>Horne prided himself on his drastic ways, and
was fond of recounting his master-strokes in
crushing out rivals. The particular coup on
which he loved to dwell was that of driving up
to an inn belonging to a middle-ground partner
of one of his enemies, and buying up all the
horses overnight, so that in the morning, when
his own coach bowled by, the rival concern was
brought to an ignominious standstill. This story,
if true, reflected no credit on either himself or
the other party to the transaction, who certainly
was liable to an action for breach of contract.
There is, however, no doubt at all that Horne
was the man to have gone to the extravagant
length of indemnifying the vendor—perhaps better
described as his accomplice—against any action-at-law.
He simply would not brook business
rivalry.</p>

<p>He was a tall, lathy, irritable man, of eager
face, quick, nervous speech, and rapid walk, with
something of a military air in his alert, upright
figure. The very antithesis of Chaplin, who was
of short stature and possessed of a nature that
nothing could ruffle, Horne must always expend
his energies on the minor details of his extensive
business, and himself do work that would have
been better delegated to subordinates. In the
end this wore him out, and brought him to a
comparatively early death. Up early, no day
was long enough for him, and he economised time
by taking no regular meal until evening. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
was generally to be seen eating his lunch out
of a paper bag as he swung furiously along the
streets. “There’s Horne,” said one of those many
who did not love him, “with the devil at his
elbow, as usual!”</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, well for him that Chaplin,
calm and level-headed, came and entered into
discussion on the railway question at that critical
time when the fortunes of coach-proprietors were
to be saved or lost by a simple declaration of
policy. The time was 1837, the occasion the
approaching opening of the first section of the
London and Birmingham Railway. Should they
hold out against the new order of things, as
Sherman was bent upon doing, or should they
enter into that alliance with the railway for
which the railway people themselves were diplomatically
angling? Chaplin thought they should,
and proposed an amalgamation of their two interests.
Horne was not so sure of railway success,
and might have continued on his own way, but
Chaplin, who was an old friend, urged his own
views. “We shall lose £10,000 apiece if we
don’t work with them,” he said, “and you won’t
like that, Benny, my boy.” Eventually Horne
agreed, and the firm of Chaplin &amp; Horne was
founded.</p>

<p>Dark rumours were current at the time that
to this newly constituted firm a sum of several
thousands of pounds was paid by the London and
Birmingham directors as the price of their friendship;
but, however that may be, the allied coach-proprietors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
agreed to withdraw their coaches from
the Birmingham Road, and to throw the weight
of their interest and influence on the side of the
railway. In return, they were given the contract
for the parcel agency of the line. Chaplin had
perceived, as Baxendale had already done in the
case of the goods traffic, that this agency would
be very valuable, and to his far-seeing counsel
Horne owed much.</p>

<p>Henry Horne, one of Benjamin Worthy
Horne’s nine brothers, became a partner with
him in 1836, and was a member of this firm of
Chaplin &amp; Horne for many years. He survived
his brother, and was at the head of affairs when
the London and North-Western Railway took
over the parcel business and the London receiving
offices in 1874. Henry was the kindest-hearted
of men, and old coaching-men down on their luck
always found him a sure draw for a loan or a
gift. Wise by dint of long experience, he laid
down a golden rule that it was cheaper in the
end to give £50 than to lend £100.</p>

<p>When the fierce old fighting days of the road
were ended and the business of Chaplin &amp; Horne
was set afoot, the restless energies of Benjamin
Worthy Horne found an outlet in the management
of the goods business in connection with
the railway, and he was constantly in and out
at Euston and Camden. In those early days the
London and North-Western Railway headquarters
staff was managed on somewhat lax and primitive
lines, and if a departmental manager thought he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
wanted a little holiday, he took it, without a word
to any one. To a strict and keen business man
like Horne these proceedings seemed particularly
strange, and were often, doubtless, the source of
much annoyance and waste of time. He had
the unchallenged run of the offices, and was so
used to finding the various managers away, on
some pretext or another, that he would humorously
assume their absence on all occasions. With his
abrupt manner, he would burst boisterously into
a room, and exclaim—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! Manager Number One out—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone fishing, no doubt!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">At the next office, whether the manager happened
to be in or not, he would enter with the same
assumption of his absence, and say—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Manager Number Two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing to do—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course, gone fishing also!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">To his especial aversion David Stevenson, the
goods manager, whom he considered to have
usurped many of his firm’s rights and privileges,
he would enter tragically with—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aha! Manager Stevenson—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone about his private theatricals!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and fix the enraged Stevenson with the haughty
stare common to the transpontine drama of the
time. The sting of it lay in the fact that
Stevenson belonged to an amateur dramatic
society.</p>

<p>The goods department at Camden was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
over by the London and North-Western Railway
in Benjamin Worthy Horne’s time, long before
the general parcels and receiving-office branch was
absorbed. The decision to terminate the contract
was a source of much annoyance to him, on
account of the reason given, which was that the
business was not efficiently conducted. Although
he was a man who in general had a horror of
going to law, this stigma upon his business methods
so stung him that he brought an action against
the railway company for breach of contract, in
order to vindicate his position. This was going
to law for an idea, and as the company had a
perfect right to terminate the contract, the action
of course failed; but it was made abundantly
evident that the business was efficiently carried
on, and that the railway was only proposing to
take it over because the time was ripe for such
a development. His heavy costs, amounting to
£1200, were afterwards very handsomely refunded
to Mr. Horne by the railway.</p>

<p>It remains to say that although there was no
keener or more ruthless man of business than
Benjamin Worthy Horne, he was privately a
considerate and kindly man, helpful and charitable
to those less successful than himself.</p>

<p>He had a pretty estate at Highlands, Mereworth,
and a town residence at 33, Russell Square. He
died at the latter place, April 14th, 1870, aged
sixty-six, leaving property valued at £250,000.</p>

<span class="subhead">COACH-PROPRIETORS (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Edward Sherman</span>, who ranked next to Chaplin
as the largest coach-proprietor in London, was in
many respects unlike his brethren in the trade.
He established himself at the “Bull and Mouth,”
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, in 1823, in succession to
Willans, and came direct from the Stock Exchange,
where he had been a broker in alliance with Lewis
Levy, a noted figure in those days of Turnpike
Trusts. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add
that Levy was a Jew. He was referred to by
Lord Ravensworth in the course of a discussion
in the House of Lords on Metropolitan Toll-gates
in 1857 as “a gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion.”
Persuasion, indeed! As well might
you describe a born Englishman or Frenchman
as born into those nationalities by personal choice
and election. Levy was, of course, a Jew by
birth, and had no choice in the matter. He was
a farmer of turnpike-tolls to the extent of half a
million sterling per annum, and a very wealthy
man. Levy put Sherman into the coaching
business, and he immediately began to make
things extremely uncomfortable for the older
proprietors, who had up to that time been content
with going at eight or nine miles an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
When Colonel Hawker took coach from the
“Bull and Mouth” in 1812, he found “the
ruffians” there “a dissatisfied, grumbling set of
fellows, and their turns-out of horses and harness
beggarly.” Such was the place under Willans’
rule, but Sherman altered all that. He was
anything but a horsy man, and it is therefore
remarkable that he should have built up the very
extensive business that the “Bull and Mouth”
Yard did almost immediately become. He was
the pioneer of fast long-distance day coaches, and
was the proprietor, at the London end, of the
“Shrewsbury Wonder,” which, like all his coaches
at that time, was a light yellow and black affair.
How long he continued subservient to Levy may
be a matter for conjecture, but when he rebuilt
the “Bull and Mouth” Hotel, in 1830, he did
so from the money of one of the three old and
wealthy ladies whom he married in succession.
The “Wonder” ran 158 miles in the day, as
against the 122 miles to Bristol; but was shortly
afterwards eclipsed by the Exeter “Telegraph,”
put on the road in 1826 in rivalry with Chaplin’s
“Quicksilver” Devonport Mail, by Mrs. Ann
Nelson, of the “Bull,” Whitechapel. In this
Sherman had only a small share. Entirely his
own venture was that supreme achievement, the
“Manchester Telegraph” day coach, started in
1833 and running 186 miles in 18 hours, technically
in the day by dint of starting at 5 o’clock in
the morning and reaching Manchester at 11 p.m.
The journey was at last shortened by one hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
when the pace, allowing twenty minutes for
dinner at Derby, and stops for changing, worked
out at just under twelve miles an hour. The
Manchester “Telegraph” day coach must by no
means be confounded with the old night coach of that
name, which in 1821 started from the “Castle and
Falcon” at 2.30 p.m., and arrived at the “Moseley
Arms,” Manchester, at 8 o’clock the next evening—29½
hours, not much more than six miles an hour.</p>

<p>The “Telegraph” day coach was built by
Waude, and was able to safely perform its
astonishingly quick journeys over what is in some
places an extremely hilly road by the introduction
of the flat springs that, from first being used on
this coach, were known as “telegraph springs,”
a name they retain to this day. They set the
fashion of low-hung coaches, which, in the
lowering of the centre of gravity, retained their
equilibrium at high rates of speed and when going
round abrupt curves. Accidents, very numerous
in those years, would have been even more
frequent had it not been for this change.</p>

<p>The heated rivalry between Sherman’s “Manchester
Telegraph” and Chaplin’s “Manchester
Defiance”—continued for some years—was but
one phase of a keen competition that raged all
round the coaching world for the possession of
the Manchester traffic. The “Swan with Two
Necks” “Defiance” may be traced back to 1821,
and even before that date, if necessary. In that
year there was not a coach that went the distance
in less than 27 hours, and in this first flight the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
“Defiance” was included. It set out at 2.30 p.m.,
and was at the “Bridgewater Arms,” Manchester,
at 5.30 the next afternoon. By 1823 it was
accelerated by two and a half hours; in 1826
it had become the “Royal Defiance,” in 24 hours.
In succeeding years it continued to go at 6.30
and 6.45 p.m., and when the “Telegraph” was
started the pace was screwed up to the same
as that of the new-comer. An evening rival
was the fast “Peveril of the Peak,” running
from the “Blossoms” inn, Lawrence Lane,
Cheapside; while Robert Nelson, of the “Belle
Sauvage,” also had a fast night coach, the Manchester
“Red Rover,” at 7 p.m., a very lurid
affair on which the guards wore red hats as
well as red coats, and the horses red harness and
collars as far as he horsed the coach out of
London. This did not long remain in his hands.
Sherman afterwards obtained it; but Nelson,
burning with professional zeal and no little
personal pique, immediately put an entirely new
coach on the same route to Cottonopolis. The
announcement of the “Beehive,” as it was called,
is distinctly worth quoting, for it shows at once
the keen rivalry between proprietors at this
period and the excellent appointments of the
later coaches:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger">“<span class="smcap">New Coach from the ‘Beehive’ Coach
Office</span></p>

<p>“Merchants, buyers, and the public in general,
visiting London and Manchester, are respectfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
informed that a new coach, called the ‘Beehive,’
built expressly, and fitted up with superior accommodation
for comfort and safety to any coach
in Europe, will leave ‘La Belle Sauvage,’
Ludgate Hill, London, at eight every morning,
and arrive in Manchester the following morning,
in time for the coaches leaving for Carlisle, Edinburgh,
and Glasgow. Passengers travelling to
the north will reach Carlisle the following
morning, being only one night on the road.
The above coach will leave the ‘Beehive’ Coach
Office, Market Street, near the Exchange, Manchester,
every evening at seven, and arrive in
London the following afternoon at three. All
small parcels sent by this conveyance will be
delivered to the farthest part of London within
two hours after the arrival of the coach. In
order to insure safety and punctuality, with respectability,
no large packages will be taken, or
fish of any description carried by this conveyance.
The inside of the coach is fitted up with spring
cushions and a reading-lamp, lighted with wax,
for the accommodation of those who wish to
amuse themselves on the road. The inside backs
and seats are also fitted up with hair cushions,
rendering them more comfortable to passengers
than anything hitherto brought out in the annals
of coaching, and, to prevent frequent disputes
respecting seats, every seat is numbered. Persons
booking themselves at either of the above places
will receive a card, with a number upon it, thereby
doing away with the disagreeables that occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
daily in the old style. The route is through
Stockport, Macclesfield, Congleton, Newcastle,
Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Coventry, Dunchurch,
Towcester, Stony Stratford, Brickhill,
Dunstable, and St. Albans, being the most level
line of country, avoiding the danger of the steep
hills through Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Sherman’s rebuilt “Bull and Mouth” inn,
or “Queen’s Hotel,” to give it its later name,
long remained a feature of St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
many years after the last coach had been withdrawn;
and the old stables in Bull and Mouth
Street, which had not been included in the rebuilding
of 1830, remained, a grim and grimy
landmark, put to use, as usually the case with
the old coach offices, as a receiving office for the
Goods Department of one of the great railways.
In later years the “Queen’s Hotel” became the
property of that very thick-and-thin supporter
of and believer in the Tichborne Claimant, Mr.
Quartermaine East; but the growth of Post Office
business made the site an exceedingly desirable
one for an extension, and in 1887 the house was
closed and demolished, and in the fulness of
time the gigantic block of buildings officially
known as “G.P.O. North” arose. Not only
were the sites of hotel and stables thus occupied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
but even Bull and Mouth Street was stopped up
and built over. The still-existing Angel Street,
close by, between “G.P.O. North” and “G.P.O.
West,” marks where another coaching inn, the
“Angel,” once stood.</p>

<p>Robert Nelson, who entered so keenly into
rivalry with Sherman over the Manchester
business, was one of the three sons of Mrs. Ann
Nelson, of the “Bull Inn,” Whitechapel. Not
the Bull “Hotel,” for Mrs. Nelson most resolutely
set her face against that new-fangled word; and
as an “inn” the house was known to the very
last. An excellent inn it was—one of the very
best. It did not seem strange then, as undoubtedly
it would now be, for so high-class a
house to be situated in this quarter of London.
Whitechapel of that time was vastly different
from the disreputable place it is to-day; but the
prime reason of so fine an inn as the “Bull”
being situated here was that this was the starting-point
of many routes into the eastern counties,
and, just as railway hotels form a usual adjunct
of railway termini, so did Mrs. Nelson possess
an excellent hotel business in addition to the
important and highly successful coaches that set
out from her yard and stables.</p>

<p>The “Bull,” Whitechapel, was sometimes—and
with equal, if not better, exactness—known as
the “Bull,” Aldgate, for it was numbered 25 in
Aldgate High Street. The relentless hand of
“improvement” swept it away in 1868, but until
that year it presented the picture of a typical old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
English hostelry, and its coffee-room, resplendent
with old polished mahogany fittings, its tables laid
with silver, and the walls adorned with numerous
specimens of those old coaching prints that are
now so rare and prized so greatly by collectors, it
wore no uncertain air of that solid and restful
comfort the newer and hustling hotels of to-day,
furnished and appointed with a distracting showiness,
are incapable of giving. Everything at the
“Bull” was solid and substantial, from the great
heavy mahogany chairs that required the strength
of a strong man to move, to the rich old English
fare, and the full-bodied port its guests were sure
of obtaining.</p>

<p>A peculiar feature of this fine establishment
of Mrs. Nelson’s was the room especially reserved
for her coachmen and guards, where those worthies
supped and dined off the best the house could
provide, at something less than cost price. Mention
has often been made of the exclusiveness of the
commercial-rooms of old, but none of those strictly
reserved haunts were so unapproachable as this
coachmen’s room at the “Bull.” There they
and the guards dined with as much circumstance
as the coffee-room guests, drank wine with the
appreciation of connoisseurs, and tipped the waiter
as freely as any travellers down the road. A
round dozen daily gathered round the table of
this sanctum, joined sometimes by well-known
amateurs of the road like Sir Henry Peyton and
the Honourable Thomas Kenyon, but only as
distinguished and quite exceptional guests. Once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
indeed, Charles Dickens sat at this table. Perhaps
he was contemplating a sequence of stories with
some such title as “The Coachmen’s Room”;
but if so, he never fulfilled the intention.
The chairman on this occasion, after sundry
flattering remarks, as a tribute to the novelist’s
power of describing a coach journey, said, “Mr.
Dickens, sir, we knows you knows wot’s wot, but
can you, sir, ’andle a vip?” There was no mock
modesty about Dickens. He acknowledged that he
<em>could</em> describe a journey down the road (doubtless,
if we have a correct mental image of the man, he
acknowledged that little matter with a truculent
suggestion in his manner that he would like to see
the man who could do it as well), but he regretted
that in the management of the “vip” he was not
an expert.</p>

<p>Unlike commercial dinners, “shop” was not
taboo round this hospitable mahogany, but formed
the staple of the conversation. Indeed, these
worthies could talk little else, and with the
exception of sometimes shrewd and humorous
sidelights on the towns and villages they passed
on their daily drives, and criticisms of the local
magnates whose parks and mansions they pointed
out to the passengers on the way, were silent on
all subjects save wheels, horses, and harness.</p>

<p>The etiquette of this room was strict. The
oldest coachman presided—never a guard, for
they always ranked as juniors—and at the proper
moment gave the loyal toast of the King or Queen.
An exception to this rule of seniority was when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Mrs. Nelson’s second son, Robert, who drove her
Exeter “Defiance,” was present, as occasionally
he was. Following the practice of the House of
Commons, whose members are never, within the
House, referred to by their own names, but
always as the representatives of their several
constituencies, Mrs. Nelson’s coachmen and guards
here assembled were addressed as “Manchester,”
“Oxford,” “Ipswich,” “Devonport,” and so forth.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Nelson retired from the active
management of the business, her eldest son, John,
became the moving spirit. It was in his time that
railways came in and coaching went out, but he was
equal to the occasion, and started a very successful
line of omnibuses, the “Wellington,” plying
between Stratford, Whitechapel, the Bank, Oxford
Street, Royal Oak, and Westbourne Grove. He
died, a very wealthy man, in June, 1868, aged
seventy-four.</p>

<p>Thomas Fagg, of the “Bell and Crown,”
Holborn—an inn better known to later generations
of Londoners as “Ridler’s Hotel”—was
a small proprietor, but he had in addition a
very lucrative business as a coach-maker at
Hartley Row, near Basingstoke. The “Louth”
and “Lynn” mails, however, were partly his, and
<i>Cary’s Itinerary</i> for 1821 gives a list of twenty-six
stage-coaches going from his door to all parts
of the country. As “Ridler’s” the house was a
very select “family hotel,” but in this it only
carried on the traditions of Fagg’s time, when he
had some most distinguished guests. Standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
midway between the West End and the City, the
“Bell and Crown” thus possessed certain advantages,
and received much patronage both from
commercial magnates and Society people. Among
his patrons he numbered the “Iron Duke,” for
whom he had an almost religious reverence, and
indeed proposed to change the name of his house
to the “Wellington,” in honour of him; only reconsidering
the project when the Duke told him—as
he commonly did the many extravagant hero-worshippers
whose attentions were a daily nuisance—not
to be “a d——d fool.” Fagg, however,
was no fool, but a very shrewd person indeed.
A coachman, applying to him for a place on one
of his coaches, was put through a strict examination
as to his qualifications, when it appeared
that he was (according to his own account) not
only a first-rate and steady “artist,” but had
never capsized a coach in the whole course of his
career—“he didn’t know what a hupset meant.”</p>

<p>“Oh! go away,” retorted the justly incensed
Fagg; “you are no man for me. <em>My</em> coaches
are always upsetting, and with <em>your</em> want of
experience, how the devil should you know how to
get one on her legs again?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mountain also had her own coach-factory.
She was no less energetic than that very lively
and masterful person, Mrs. Ann Nelson, but in a
smaller way of business. Sarah Ann Mountain’s
house was that “Saracen’s Head,” Snow Hill,
immortalised by Dickens in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.
She had succeeded to the business in 1818, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
death of her husband, and instead of giving up,
decided to carry on, aided by Peter, her son.
Thirty coaches left her inn daily, among them the
first of the Birmingham “Tally-Ho’s,” a fast day
coach, established in 1823, and historically interesting
as the prime cause of the furious racing
that characterised the St. Albans and Coventry
route to Birmingham from this date until 1838.
Mrs. Mountain’s coach-factory was at the rear of
her premises on Snow Hill. There she built the conveyances
used by herself and partners, charging them
at the rather high rate of 3½<i>d.</i> a mile for their use.</p>

<p>A number of smaller proprietors accounted,
between them, for many other coaches. Robert
Gray, once established at the “Belle Sauvage,”
left that place in 1807 and settled at the “Bolt-in-Tun,”
a house still standing in Fleet Street,
and now known as the “Bolt-in-Tun” London
and North-Western Railway Receiving Office.
He sent out twenty-five coaches daily, almost
exclusively down the southern and western roads,
among them the Portsmouth and the Hastings
mails, the latter a pair-horse concern.</p>

<p>William Gilbert, of the “Blossoms” inn,
Laurence Lane, Cheapside, had also a pair-horse
mail—the “Brighton”—the “Tantivy,” Birmingham
coach, and a fast night coach to Manchester,
the “Peveril of the Peak.” Seventeen other
coaches left his yard.</p>

<p>Joseph Hearn, proprietor of the “King’s
Arms,” Snow Hill, was monarch among the slow-coaches,
of which he had twenty-two. Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
them were the Bicester “Regulator,” the Boston
“Perseverance,” and the Leicester and Market
Harborough “Convenience”—names that do not
spell speed. Even his Aylesbury “Despatch”
was a slow affair, reaching that town in six hours,
at the rate of six and a half miles an hour.</p>

<p>Many great coach-proprietors were established
in the chief provincial towns. Bretherton, of
Liverpool, described by Chaplin as “an exceedingly
opulent man,” Wetherald, at Manchester,
Teather, of Carlisle, Waddell, at Birmingham,
are names that stand forth prominently. The
cross-country rivalry between these men was quite
as bitter as that which raged among the Londoners,
and, although with the lapse of time the exact
explanation of the following extraordinary epitaph
on a coach-proprietor of Bolton, Lancashire, cannot
be given, it is doubtless to be found in one of
these business feuds:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sacred to the Memory of Frederic Webb, Coach Proprietor,
of the firm of Webb, Houlden, &amp; Co., of Bolton, who departed
this life the 9th December, 1825, aged 23 years. Not being
able to combat the malevolence of his enemies, who sought his
destruction, he was taken prematurely from an affectionate loving
wife and infant child, to deplore the loss of a good husband,
whose worth was unknown, and who died <em>an honest man</em>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The inference intended to be drawn was
obviously that the others were not honest men;
but, honest or not, they are all gone to their
account, and the world has forgotten them and
their contentions. Only the stray historian of these
things comes upon their infrequent footmarks,
and wonders greatly at their elemental ferocity.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1 in0"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> Horace sings, in his Ode to Mæcenas; and
the driving ambition observed by that old heathen,
still to be noticed in these days, was a very marked
feature of the road at any time between 1800 and
1848, when the railways had succeeded in disestablishing
almost every coach, and the opportunities
of the gentleman coachman were gone.</p>

<p>The amateur coachman was a creation of the
nineteenth century, He was, for two very good
reasons, unknown before that time. The first was
that coachmanship had not yet become an art,
and, still in the hands of mere drivers whose only
recommendations were an ability to endure long
hours on the box and a brutal efficiency in punishing
the horses, had no chance of developing those
refinements that characterised the Augustan age
of coaching; the second reason was that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
box-seat, although perhaps already beginning to be
regarded as a place of distinction, was much more
certainly a very painful eminence. It rested
directly upon the front axle, and, being wholly
innocent of springs, received and transmitted to
the frame of any one who occupied it every shock
the wheels encountered on the rough roads of
that time.</p>

<p>Springs under the driving-box were unknown
until about 1805, when they were introduced by
John Warde, of Squerryes, the old Kentish squire
who is generally known as the “Father of Foxhunting.”
He was the first amateur coachman,
and in pursuing that hobby found the driving-seats
of the old coaches anything but comfortable.
In resisting his arguments in favour of the introduction
of springs, the coach-proprietors declared
to a man that the coachmen would always be
falling asleep if they were provided with comfortable
seats.</p>

<p>John Warde’s driving exploits were chiefly
carried out on the Oxford, Gloucester, and Birmingham
roads. For years before coachmanship
became a fashionable accomplishment, he had been
accustomed to take the professional coachman’s
place on the “old Gloucester” stage, “six inside
and sixteen out, with two tons of luggage”; or,
relieving Jack Bailey and other incumbents of the
bench on the old Birmingham and Shrewsbury
“Prince of Wales,” would drive the whole distance
between London and Birmingham. He once drove
this coach from London to Oxford against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
“Worcester Old Fly” for a wager, and won it,
although his coach went the Benson road, four
miles longer than the route his opponent had to
travel.</p>

<p>Warde’s driving was by no means in the later
style, and he probably would have been very much
out of his element with the smart galloping teams
of the Golden Age. He was, however, of those
who were fit to be trusted with a heavy load
behind weak horses and on bad roads. There was
a peculiarity about him as regarded the driving of
his own horses which the history of the road, it
was said, could not parallel. Let the journey be
in length what it might, he never took the horses
out of his private coach, giving them only now
and then a little hay and a mouthful of water
at a roadside public-house. When he resided in
Northamptonshire, sixty-three miles from London,
the journey was always accomplished by his team
“at a pull,” as he called it. The pace, as may be
supposed, was not quick. John Warde was one
of the founders of the B.D.C., or Benson Driving
Club, in 1807.</p>

<p>Amateur coaching, as a fashionable amusement,
took its rise on the Brighton Road. Looked
upon with contempt by stalwart and bluff Warde
and his kind, it nevertheless grew and flourished
in the hands of the Barrymores and their contemporaries,
Sir John Lade and Colonel Mellish;
and in the early years of the nineteenth century
the education of no gay young blood was complete
until he had acquired the art of driving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
four-in-hand, in addition to the already fashionable
and highly dashing sport of driving the light
whiskies, the high-perched curricles, and the
toppling tilburies that then gave a fearful joy to
the newly-fledged whip. There was not too much
physical exertion, endurance, or skill required on
the road to Brighton, which was only fifty-two
miles in length, and already possessed a better
surface than most roads out of London; and,
moreover, it was a road peopled from beginning
to end with fashionables, before whom the gentleman-coachman
could display his prowess. It was
then pretty generally recognised that coach-driving
was a poor sport if the ease and grace
of the performer could not be displayed before a
large and fashionable audience. That, it will be
conceded, was not altogether a worthy attitude.</p>

<p>Many of these brilliant amateurs of the road
ran an essentially identical career of viciousness
and mad extravagance; and not a few of them
wasted themselves and their substance in the
very shady pursuits that then characterised the
“man about town.” Those who are curious about
such things may find them fully set forth in
Pierce Egan’s <i>Life in London</i> and its grim
sequel, the <i>Finish</i>. The endings of the Toms
and Jerrys of that Corinthian age were generally
sordid and pitiful.</p>

<p>The truth is that the sporting world was then,
as it always has been and always will be, thronged
with the toadies who were ever ready to fool a
moneyed youngster to the top of his bent. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243<br /><a id="Page_244">244</a><br /><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
must vie with the richer and the more experienced,
though he ruin himself in the doing of it, and
bring his ancestral acres to the hammer, in the
manner of a Mytton or a Mellish. The only
satisfaction these reckless sportsmen obtained,
beyond the immediate gratification of their tastes,
was the eulogy of the sporting scribes, who
discussed their style upon the box-seat with as
much gravity as would befit some question of
empire. Excepting “Nimrod” and “Viator
Junior,” whose essays on sport in general, and
coaching in particular, were sound and honest
criticism, these writers were venal and beneath
contempt.</p>

<p>A “real gentleman,” according to the ideas
of these parasites, was one who flung away his
money broadcast in tips. Many foolish fellows,
foolish in thinking the good opinions of these
gentry worth having, spent their substance in
this way. Of this kind was the amateur whip
described by a writer in the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>
in 1831. This aspirant for the goodwill of the
stable-helpers and their sort sat beside the professional
coachman on the Poole Mail starting
from Piccadilly, and when the reins were handed
to him proclaimed his gentility by the distribution
of shillings among the horsekeepers. First “Nasty
Bob,” the ostler, got a shilling for talking about
the leaders’ “haction”; then “Greedy Dick,”
the boots, had one also for handing him the
“vip”; and then came “Sneaking Will,” the
cad and coach-caller, to say something civil to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the “gemman”; and even the neighbouring
waterman was seduced from his hackney-coaches
to try the persuasive powers of his eloquence.
Four shillings and sixpence this “real gentleman”
distributed at Hatchett’s door, and left
the capital with the best wishes of the donees
for his safe return. His generosity was not
allowed a long respite, for at “that vile hole
Brentford,” a slowly manœuvring waggoner
blocked the way; and finding that he could by
no other means be induced to allow the mail to
pass, our amateur descended from the box, and,
slyly placing a shilling in the waggoner’s hands,
said in a loud voice, “I don’t stand any nonsense,
you know, so now take your waggon out of the
way.” This forcible and intelligible appeal, so
properly accompanied, was perfectly irresistible:
the waggon was drawn to the roadside, and the
mail proceeded.</p>

<p>Very few of these amateurs have been considered
worthy of biographical treatment, but
among them Sir St. Vincent Cotton is one. Let
us just see what the outline of his life was:—“Cotton,
Sir St. Vincent, 6th Baronet, son of
Admiral Sir Charles Cotton. Born at Madingley
Hall, Cambs., October 6th, 1801; succeeded,
February 24th, 1812; educated at Westminster
and Christ Church, Oxford. Cornet 10th Light
Dragoons, May 13th, 1827; Lieutenant, December
13th, 1827, to November 19th, 1830, when placed
on half-pay. Distinguished himself in the hunting,
skating, racing, and pugilistic world. Played in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Marylebone Cricket Matches, 1830–35. A great
player at hazard. Dissipated all his property.
Drove the ‘Age’ coach from Brighton to London
and back for some years from 1836. Died at 5,
Hyde Park Terrace, January 25th, 1863.”</p>

<p>It is possible to largely supplement this
skeleton biography from the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>
and other sources. “The Cottons of Madingley
and Landwade,” said that classic authority, “are
no ‘soft goods’ of recent manufacture, but have
held high rank among the gentry of Cambridgeshire
since the reign of Edward I. Sir John
Cotton, the first baronet of the family, was advanced
to that honour in 1641, by Charles I.,
to whose cause he was firmly attached. Sir
St. Vincent used to ride in the first flight with
the crack men of Leicestershire, mounted on his
favourite mare, ‘Lark.’ The honourable baronet
has, however, left both the Army and the Chase
to devote himself exclusively to the public service
on the ‘Road,’ where he performs the duties of a
coachman very much to his own pleasure, and the
great satisfaction of all His Majesty’s lieges who
travel by the Brighton ‘Age’; and we are of
opinion that an English baronet is much better
employed in driving a coach than in endeavouring—like
a certain mole-eyed wiseacre of the West,
who also displays the Red Hand on his scutcheon—to
saw off the branch that he is sitting on.</p>

<p>“We believe that the late Mr. H. Stevenson,
who drove the ‘Age’ a few years ago, was one
of the first gentleman-whips who took a <em>bob</em> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
returned a <em>bow</em>—<i>i.e.</i>, if you popped a shilling into
his hand at the end of a stage, he ducked his head
and said, ‘Thank you.’ The example thus set
has been followed by the Baronet, who receives
a ‘hog’ as courteously as his predecessor. When
a noble Marquis, now in the enjoyment of an
hereditary dukedom, drove the ‘Criterion,’ and
afterwards the ‘Wonder,’ also on the Brighton
Road, he did not take ‘civility money,’ we
believe, but did the thing for pure love.</p>

  <div class="caption">SIR ST. VINCENT COTTON.</div></div>

<p>Cotton, known to the plebeian professionals of
the Brighton Road as “the Baronet,” and to his
familiars as “Vinny,” was so hard hit by his
disastrous gambling that he owned and drove the
Brighton “Age” for a living. Let us do him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249<br /><a id="Page_250">250</a><br /><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
justice to add that he did not attempt to disguise
the fact, and that he took his misfortunes bravely,
like a sportsman. Reduced, as a consequence of
his own folly, from an income of £5000 a year to
nothing, “I drive for a livelihood,” he said to a
friend: “Jones, Worcester, and Stevenson have
their liveried servants behind, who pack the
baggage and take all short fares and pocket all
the fees. That’s all very well for them. I do
all myself, and the more civil I am (particularly
to the old ladies) the larger fees I get.” He,
indeed, made £300 a year out of this coach, and
got his sport for nothing.</p>

<p>The “Jones” of whom he spoke was Charles
Tyrwhitt Jones, of whom, being just an amateur
with no eccentricities, we know little. Of Harry
Stevenson, one of the most distinguished and
accomplished among amateurs of the road, we
know a good deal, although even of his short life
full particulars have never been secured. He
made his first appearance on the Brighton
Road in August 1827, as part-proprietor of the
“Coronet,” and even then his name seems to have
been one to conjure with, for it was for painting
it on a coach of which he was not one of the
licensees that Cripps was fined in November of
that year. Stevenson was then but little more
than twenty-three years of age. He had gone
from Eton to Cambridge, and during his exceptionally
short career was always known by the
fraternity of the road as “the Cambridge graduate.”
Although so little is known of him, sufficient has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
come down to us to place him on a higher pedestal
than that of the majority of the gentlemen
amateurs. He was not only a supreme artist with
the ribbons, “whose passion for the <em>bench</em>,” as
“Nimrod” says, “exceeded all other worldly ambitions,”
but he was also a supremely good fellow,
in a broader and better significance of that misused
term than generally implied. That he was
one of the spendthrifts who had run through their
money before taking to the road as a professional
would appear to be a baseless statement, invented
perhaps to account for that higher form of
sportsmanship which entirely transcended that
of the general ruck of “sportsmen,” by inducing
him to drive his coach, as an ordinary professional
would, day by day, instead of when fine weather
and the inclination of the moment served. A
good professional he made, for he did by no means
forget his birth and education when on the box,
and was singularly refined and courteous. His
second, and famous, coach was the “Age,” put on
the Brighton Road in 1828. This celebrated coach
eclipsed all the others of that time, from the mere
point of view of elegance and comfort. On a road
like that to Brighton there was not, of course,
the chance to rival such flyers as the Devonport
“Quicksilver” and other long-distance cracks;
but in every circumstance of its equipment it
was pre-eminent. It was not for nothing that
Stevenson loved the road. His ambition was to
be first on it, and he succeeded. The “Age” was
built and finished, horsed and found in every way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
without regard to cost. In a time when brass-mounted
harness was your only wear, his was
silver-plated. The horse-cloths, too, exhibited this
unusual elegance, for they were edged with deep
silver lace and gold thread, and embroidered in
each corner with a royal crown and a sprig of
laurel in coloured silks and silver. These cloths
were, many years afterwards, presented to the
Brighton Museum by Mr. Thomas Ward Capps, a
later proprietor of the “Age,” and they are still
to be seen there.</p>

<p>This was not by any means the sum of Stevenson’s
improvements. The usual guard he replaced
by a liveried servant, whom he caused to attend
upon the passengers, when the coach changed
horses, with silver sandwich-box and offers of
sherry of a kind that appealed even to the jaded
palates of connoisseurs. Stevenson was as excellent
a whip as he was a good-hearted gentleman. “I
am not aware,” wrote “Viator Junior,” “if, to
quote a vulgar saying, he was ‘born with a silver
spoon in his mouth,’ but I certainly think he
must have been brought into the world with a
whip and reins in his hand, for in point of ease
and elegance of execution as a light coachman
he beats nineteen out of twenty of the regular
working dragsmen into fits, and as an amateur
is only to be approached by two or three of the
chosen few.”</p>

<p>Of course, coaching on these luxurious terms
resulted in a staggering loss, and could not long
have continued, but even those short possibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
were ended by the early death of Stevenson. The
cause of the attack of brain-fever that ended his
career early in 1830 is imperfectly known, and
is merely said to have been “an accident.” The
last scene was pathetic beyond the ordinary.
Exhausted at the end of delirium, the bandages
that had held his arms were removed, when,
feebly raising himself up in bed and assuming
as well as he was able his old habitual attitude
upon the box, he exclaimed, as if with the reins
in his hand, and to his favourite servant, who
usually stood at his leaders’ heads, “Let them
go, George; I’ve got ’em!” and so sank down,
dying, upon his pillow, in the happy delusion of
being once more upon the road.</p>

<p>Mr. Harry Foker and others of the “young
Oxonians” or “young Cantabs” with more taste
for driving four-in-hand than knowledge of that
very difficult art, were frequent aspirants for the
ribbons, and as they were generally flush of
money and free with it, they often tasted the
delights of tooling a coach along the highway.
Professional coachmen on the Oxford and Cambridge
roads reaped a bounteous crop of half-guineas
by resigning the reins into these hands,
but equally plentiful was the harvest of bruises
and shocks gathered by the passengers as a result
of their reckless or unskilled driving. These
chartered libertines of the road are mentioned
with horror by travellers in the first half of the
nineteenth century, who have pictured for us
four horses galloping at the incredible speed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255<br /><a id="Page_256">256</a><br /><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
twenty miles an hour, and the coaches rocking
violently, while the “outsides” hold on like
firemen, behind some uncertificated young cub
from Oxford or Cambridge, or, anticipating the
final cataclysm, drop off behind or dive into
the hedges.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING DROVE BY A GENTLEMAN.
<span class="fright"><i>After H. Alken.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Even more than the passengers, coach-proprietors
dreaded amateur coachmen, and very
properly dismissed those professionals whom they
caught allowing the reins out of their charge.
They had cause for this dread, for not only
was the act of allowing amateurs to drive itself
an illegal one, entailing penalties, but it often
resulted in accidents, bringing in their train
very heavy compensation claims. Juries invariably
satisfied themselves as to whether a professional
or an amateur was driving at the time
when an accident occurred, and assessed damages
accordingly.</p>

<p>Sir St. Vincent Cotton was the cause of a
serious accident that happened to the “Star of
Cambridge.” Springing the horses over a favourable
stretch of galloping-ground, he went at such
a reckless pace that Jo Walton, the professional
coachman, seized hold of the reins. In doing
so the coach was overturned, and the passengers
severely injured. A jockey named Calloway
had his leg broken, and, with others, brought
an action for damages. The affair cost Robert
Nelson and his partners nearly two thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>A good amateur coachman was, as a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
rule, like an accomplished violinist, only to be
produced by long training. Caught young and
properly schooled, he might become an elegant
as well as a thorough whip; but the late-comer
rarely attained both grace and complete mastery.
“He who would master this most fascinating
science of coachmanship,” says Dashwood, in the
<i>New Sporting Magazine</i>, “must begin early,
under good tuition. He must work constantly
on all kinds of coaches, and, thereby accustoming
himself to every description of team to be met
with, no matter how difficult or unpleasant, will
ere long acquire a practical knowledge on that
all-important point, the art of putting horses
well together.” He then proceeds to sigh for
one hour of “old Bill Williams,” of the “Oxford
Defiance,” who, as a schoolmaster of gentlemen-aspirants
to coaching honours was, in his time,
unequalled. He was supposed to have turned
out more efficient coachmen than all the rest of
his brethren put together. “Never by any
chance—confound him!—would he allow an error
or ungraceful act to escape unnoticed, and I have
often got off his box so annoyed at his merciless
reproofs and lectures that I vowed no power on
earth should make me touch another rein for him.
The first morning, in particular, that I was with
him I shall never forget. In spite of all my
remonstrances, nothing would satisfy him but I
must take the reins from the door of the very
office, at the ‘Belle Sauvage,’ he himself getting
up behind, in order, as he said, not to ‘fluster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the young ‘un.’ By great good luck we got
pretty well into the street, and, without anything
worth telling, for some way past Temple Bar;
but, as my evil star would have it, the narrow
part of the Strand was uncommonly full, and
having rather an awkward team, and being moreover
in a pretty particular stew, we had more
than one squeak at sundry posts, drays, etc., etc.
Still, not a word was uttered by the artist, though
by this time he had scrambled in front, till, after
a devil of a mistake in turning into the Hay-market,
he touched my arm very civilly, with a
‘Pull up, if you please, sir, by that empty coal-cart.’
I did so—at least, as well as I could—and
found, to my utter horror, that it was for the
purpose of his requesting the grinning blackamoors
that belonged to it <em>to lend him some six
or seven of their sacks, to take the drag home</em>;
‘for,’ said he, ‘I am sure the gentleman won’t
take it up to the Gloucester Coffee House <em>a
coach</em>.’”</p>

<span class="subhead">END OF THE COACHING AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“This is the patent age of inventions.”—<cite>Byron.</cite></p>

<p class="p1 in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1789, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, of Shrewsbury,
in writing his poem, the <cite>Loves of the Plants</cite>,
penned a most remarkably accurate prophecy,
comparable with Mother Shipton’s earlier “carriages
without horses shall go.” He wrote:—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam, afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drag the slow barge, or urge the rapid car;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on wide waving wings expanded bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flying chariot through the realms of air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair crews, triumphant, smiling from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wave their fluttering kerchiefs as they move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or warrior bands alarm the gaping crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And armies shrink beneath the rushing cloud.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The first part of this prophecy was fulfilled in
the period between 1823 and 1833, when steam-carriages—the
motor-cars of that age—had a brief
popularity.</p>

<p>Before railways successfully assailed the coaches,
horsed vehicles had faced the inventions of a
number of ingenious persons who wrestled with
that problem of steam traction on common roads
which had attracted Murdock in 1781. Trevithick
took it up in 1800, and others followed; but it
was not until 1823 that the subject began greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
to interest engineers. At that period, however,
Hancock, Ogle, Church, Gurney, Summers, Squire,
Maceroni, Hills and Scott-Russell plunged into
that troubled sea of invention. Chief among
these, from the standpoint of results achieved,
were Mr. (afterwards Sir) Goldsworthy Gurney,
Walter Hancock, and Colonel Maceroni. Gurney
as early as 1827 had patented and tried a steam-carriage
on the road. The boiler, it was explained
for the benefit of nervous people, was perfectly
safe. Even if it were to burst, being “constructed
on philosophical principles,” no one could be hurt.
On July 28th, 1829, he ran one of his inventions
on the Bath Road. This was what he termed a
“steam-tractor,” used as an engine to draw an
ordinary barouche. Unfortunately for Gurney,
he and his party reached Melksham on the annual
fair-day, and a hostile crowd of rustics not only
surrounded the steam-carriage, shouting “Down
with machinery!” but stoned the engine, the
carriage, and Gurney and his friends, with such
effect that the machinery was disabled and several
of the party very seriously injured.</p>

<p>But he evidently travelled the kingdom pretty
extensively with his machines, for he agreed with
one Mr. Hanning to grant him the right of working
them on a royalty on the West of England
roads, and entered into similar arrangements on
the routes between London, Manchester, and
Liverpool, London and Brighton, London and
Southampton, and London, Birmingham, and
Holyhead. Their price was agreed upon—to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
hired at 6<i>d.</i> a mile, or to be sold by Gurney at
£1000 each. During four months at the beginning
of 1831, Sir Charles Dance, who had bought some
of the carriages, established a steam service on the
road between Cheltenham and Gloucester. Three
double journeys a day were made, 396 regular
trips in all, covering 3644 miles, and conveying
2666 passengers, who paid £202 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in fares.
The enterprise was just beginning to show a profit
when the local Trusts secured an Act under which
they raised the tolls against steam-carriages to a
prohibitive height, and even went so far as to
obstruct the roads with loose gravel and stones,
with the result that the axle of one machine was
broken.</p>

<p>In June 1831 the “philosophical” boiler of
one of Gurney’s steam-carriages, warranted not
to burst disastrously, exploded at Glasgow, and
seriously injured two boys. Tom Hood wrote:—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Instead of <em>journeys</em>, people now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May go upon a <em>Gurney</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steam to do the horses’ work<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By power of attorney;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">And you may all be undone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find you’re going up to Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Instead of up to London.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Yet a Select Committee of the House of Commons,
which had been appointed to consider the question
of steam-carriages, reported, four months later,
that such carriages could be propelled at an
average rate of ten miles an hour; that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
would become a cheaper and speedier mode of
conveyance than carriages drawn by horses, and
that they were perfectly safe (!).</p>

<p>Between 1832 and 1838 there were no fewer
than seven important Steam-Carriage Companies
in existence, and probably, had it not been for
the hostility of Turnpike Trusts all over the
country, the roads would have been peopled with
mechanically-propelled vehicles. But tolls were
raised to such a height against the new-fangled
inventions that it became commercially impossible
to run them. Between Liverpool and Prescot
the 4<i>s.</i> toll for a coach became £2 8<i>s.</i> for a
steam-carriage; between Ashburton and Totnes
the 3<i>s.</i> impost became £2.</p>

<p>Evidently, from a coloured print published in
1833, Goldsworthy Gurney projected a London
and Bath service, but the turnpike authorities
crushed that also. An inscription under the
original print obligingly tells us all about this
type of Gurney’s carriages:—</p>

<p>“The Guide or Engineer is seated in front,
having a lever rod from the two guide-wheels, to
turn and direct the Carriage, and another at his
right hand, connecting with the main Steam Pipe,
by which he regulates the motion of the Vehicle—the
hind part of the Coach contains the machinery
for producing the Steam, on a novel and secure
principle, which is conveyed by Pipes to the
Cylinders beneath, and by its action on the hind
wheels sets the Carriage in motion. The Tank,
which contains about 60 Gallons of water, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
placed under the body of the Coach, and is its
full length and breadth. The Chimneys are fixed
on the top of the hind boot, and, as Coke is used
for fuel, there will be no smoke, while any hot
or rarified air produced will be dispelled by the
action of the Vehicle. At different stations on a
journey, the Coach receives fresh supplies of fuel
and water. The full length of the Carriage is
from 15 to 20 feet, and its weight about 2 tons.
The rate of travelling is intended to be from 8
to 10 miles per hour. The present Steam Carriage
carries 6 inside and 12 outside Passengers. The
front Boot contains the Luggage. It has been
constructed by Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney, the
Inventor and Patentee.”</p>

<p>Gurney was held, by a Parliamentary Committee,
to be “foremost for practical utility”;
but that statement was owing, there is little
doubt, to the influence of his many friends in
Parliament. Hancock’s steam-carriages were at
least as efficient—but then he had no such
influential supporters. Gurney claimed to have
lost £36,000 directly in his experiments, and a
much larger sum indirectly, through the excessive
tolls imposed, and brought his grievances before
Parliament. A Committee recommended a grant
of £16,000 to him, as the first to successfully
apply steam-carriages to use on public roads.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After G. Morton.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>In 1824 Walter Hancock was experimenting
on similar lines, but it was not until 1828 that
a proposal was made to run a service of steam-carriages
between London and Brighton, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265<br /><a id="Page_266">266</a><br /><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
until November 1832 that his “Infant” actually
made the attempt. It had already, at the
beginning of 1831, plied for public service as an
omnibus between Stratford and London, and now
was to essay those 52 miles between London and
the sea.</p>

<p>It performed the double journey, but, owing
to lack of fuel on the way, not in anything like
record time, although it is said in places to have
attained a speed of 13 miles an hour.</p>

<p>In 1833 Hancock started a steam omnibus
between Paddington and the City, and by 1836
had three. Between them, they conveyed no
fewer than 12,761 passengers. They were named
the “Era,” “Autopsy,” and “Automaton.” Why
the middle one should have been named in a
manner so suggestive of accidents and post-mortem
examinations is not clear. But indeed,
the names of old-time and modern motor-cars
and their inventors, strange to say, generally
have been, and are now, sometimes singularly
unfortunate. Thus, in 1824, a Scotch inventor
of Leith produced a steam-carriage. His name
was Burstall! Among recent motor-cars are the
“Mors” and the “Hurtu.”</p>

<p>In October 1833 Hancock ran the “Autopsy”
to Brighton in 8½ hours (including three hours
in stops on the way), and later had successful
trips to Marlborough and back and Birmingham
and back. These performances were considered
so promising that a “London and Birmingham
Steam-Coach Company” was formed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
more steam-coaches ordered to be built. Fares
between London and Birmingham were not to
exceed £1 each, inside, and 10<i>s.</i> out. Hancock,
a thorough believer in his invention and its
capacity for solving the road-problems of the
time, offered to carry the mails at 20 miles an
hour; but the Post Office declined. Railways
had, in fact, just succeeded in attracting attention,
and were so strongly supported by capitalists
that steam-carriages suffered neglect, and their
inventors were utterly discouraged. Bright hopes
and prospects gradually faded away, and by 1838
the railways held the field, undisputed.</p>

<p>Railways themselves were at first ridiculed,
and suffered from the necessity of obtaining
Parliamentary sanction at a period when the
landowning interests and public opinion were
decidedly hostile. Even when their construction
was authorised, every one ridiculed the railways,
and called those people fools who had invested
their money in them. To be a railway shareholder
was at that time, to the majority of people,
proof positive of insanity, while engineers and
directors were regarded as curious compounds of
fools and rogues. Any time between 1833 and
1837, the coachmen on the Great North Road
would point out to their box-seat passengers the
works of the London and Birmingham in progress
beside that highway, and distinctly visible all
the way between Potter’s Bar and Hatfield and
at various other points. “Going to run us off
the road, <em>they say</em>” a coachman would remark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
jerking his elbow and nodding his head towards
the place where hundreds of navvies were delving
in a cutting or tipping an embankment. Then,
squirting a stream of saliva from between his
front teeth, in the practised manner assiduously
cultivated by admiring amateurs, he would lapse
into a contemplative silence, quite undisturbed
by any suspicion that the railway really would
run the coaches off. The passengers by coach
were nearly all of the same mind. Some thought
the railways would be useful in carrying goods,
but declined to believe that they or any one else
would ever travel by them; and a large proportion
of the railway directors and proprietors
shared the same opinion, being quite convinced
that railways would convey heavy articles and
general merchandise, and that coaches would
continue to run as of old. Lovers of the road,
coachmen and passengers alike, called the engines
“tea-kettles,” protested that coaching had nothing
to fear, and wished their heads might never ache
until railroads came into fashion. They declared
they would never—no, <em>never</em>—go by the railroad;
but at length, when some urgent occasion arose,
demanding speed, they trusted their precious
persons in a railway train, and, to their surprise,
found it “not so bad after all.” The next
occasion, such a person going to town would
shrink as he encountered the “Swallow” coach,
by which he had always travelled, and would feel
guilty as he shook his head to the coachman’s
“Coming by me this morning, sir?” Why?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Because he had made up his mind to go by train,
and so save something in time and pocket. This
time our traveller rather liked it; and thus the
“Swallow,” and many another coach not already
withdrawn, was doomed.</p>

<p>Let us follow the career of such a coach, to
its last days.</p>

<p>Deprived of its best passengers, the exchequer
of our typical “Swallow” began to decline. The
stalwarts, whose love for the road was superior to
economy of time and money, were faithful, but
they were not numerous enough, and did not
travel sufficiently often, for the old style of that
fast post-coach to be maintained, so it was reduced
from four horses to three. In coaching parlance,
it ran “pickaxe,” or “unicorn.” No connoisseur
in coaching matters would condescend to travel as
a regular thing by a three-horse coach, and so
those supporters were alienated, and, against their
will, driven to the railway; and the “Swallow,”
badly winged, carried only frightened old women
who looked upon steam-engines as wild beasts.
As they died away, no one took their places, and
the old concern became a pair-horse coach. The
coachman had seen the change coming, and
declared he would never be brought so low as
to drive two horses. He had said the same
thing when it was proposed to have three. “Drive
unicorn!” he had said: “never!” But he did,
and he drove pair-horse as well, when the time
came. It was better to do so than to lose his place
and face starvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
By this time the iron had entered the soul of
our poor old friend, and had rusted there. He
who had been so smart and gay, with song and
joke and always good-humoured, suffered, like the
coach, a strange and pitiful metamorphosis. The
stringency of the times had thinned the establishment,
and in the absence of ostlers and stablemen
he put in the horses himself, badly groomed, and
the harness dirty. No one washed or cleaned the
coach, and it ran with the mud and dirt of many
journeys encrusted on its sides. His coat grew
seedy, his gloves soiled. Instead of the silver-mounted
whip he had wielded for years, he used
one of common make. The old one, he said, had
gone to be repaired, but somehow or another the
job was never completed. At any rate, no one
ever saw the old whip again. At the same time his
smart white hat disappeared and was replaced by
a black one: observant people, however, perceived
that it was the identical hat, disguised by process
of dyeing. He could sink no deeper, you think.
But he could, and did. Even the short journey to
which the old “Swallow” had in course of time
been reduced by railway extensions came at last to
an end; and then he drove the “Railway Bus”
to and from the station, with one horse. His
temper, once so high-mettled, had by now grown
uncertain. He was like an April day—stormy,
dull, gloomy, and with fitful gleams of sunshine,
all in turn. No one knew quite how to take
him, and every one at last left him very much
to himself. He was never a favourite with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
“commercial gentlemen,” who were now his most
frequent passengers, for he had always in the old
days looked down upon any one under the rank of
a county gentleman, and could by no means rid
himself of that ancient attitude of mind. Indeed,
he lived in the past, and when he could be induced
to talk at all, would generally be reminiscent of
better days. Commencing with the unvaried
formula, “I’ve seen the time when....” he would
then proceed to draw comparisons, much to the
disadvantage of present time and present company.
He was then absurdly surprised when acquaintance,
tired of these tactless speeches, avoided him.
Not so quick in his movements as of yore, and
always impatient of dictation, he resented the
bluff impatience of a “commercial” one morning,
and when that “ambassador of commerce” desired
him to “look alive there, now, with those boxes,”
flung the boxes themselves on the ground, and
told that astonished traveller to “go and be
damned!” Unfortunately, although the traveller
would have overlooked the insolence, he could not
afford to disregard the loss of his samples, which
happened to be china, and were all smashed. He
reported the occurrence to the hotel-proprietor,
who, being a compassionate man, explained, as he
instantly dismissed the offender, that he was very
sorry, but he could not afford to keep so violent
a man in his employ.</p>

<p>After this dramatic incident the ex-coachman
hung about the station, and obtained a few, a very
few, odd jobs as porter, until one day a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
alighting from a train saw him. With surprise
and sorrow in his eyes he recognised the once
smart coachman, who, years before, had tutored
him in driving. “Good God!” he exclaimed:
“is it you?” The old man burst into tears.</p>

<p>He ended more happily than, but for this
chance, would have been the case, for the Squire
took him into his service, and there he remained
until he followed his generation to the Beyond.</p>

<p>The opening of the London and Birmingham
Railway in September 1838 did not suddenly
bring the Coaching Age to a close. Many
routes remained for years afterwards practically
unassailed, and even on the road to Birmingham
some coach-proprietors struggled with great spirit
against the direct competition of the railway.
At the close of 1838 a newspaper is found saying:
“A few months ago no fewer than twenty-two
coaches left Birmingham daily for London. Since
the opening of the railway that number has been
reduced to four, and it is expected that these will
be discontinued, although the fares by coach are
only 20<i>s.</i> inside and 10<i>s.</i> outside, whilst the fares
for corresponding places on the railroad are 30<i>s.</i>
and 20<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>Prominent among those men who declined to
give up without a struggle was Sherman, of the
“Bull and Mouth,” whose coaches had run to
Birmingham, Manchester, and other places on
the north-western road. For two years he maintained
the unequal contest, and only relinquished
it when he had lost seven thousand pounds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
found his coaches running empty. Before finally
beaten, he had even gone the length of re-establishing
some coaches originally withdrawn in
1836, on the opening of the Grand Junction
Railway. The reasons for this were many. The
train-service in those early days was very
poor, and engine-power insufficient, so that heavy
loads, rain-showers that made the rails slippery,
and the innumerable minor accidents always
happening to the engines themselves, made
travelling by railway not only uncertain, but,
in not a few instances, even slower than by
coach. Railway officials, too, were insolent to
an incredible degree. Only when one has read
the “Letters to the Editor” in contemporary
journals can we have any idea of that insolence.
The public complained that, having run the
coaches off and secured a monopoly, the officials,
finding themselves masters of the situation,
behaved accordingly like masters, and not like the
servants of the public they really were, or should
have been. Newspaper comments dotted the i’s
and crossed the t’s, and generally emphasised and
embroidered these grievances. It is not, then,
to be wondered at that a regret for “the good
old times” found expression, or that coaches
reappeared for a while. Many coach-proprietors
were deceived by this partly indignant, partly
sentimental attitude, and when they had committed
themselves to a revival did not find the
support which, from the newspaper outcry, they
might reasonably have expected. Thus early do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275<br /><a id="Page_276">276</a><br /><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
we find that gigantic evil of modern times—irresponsible
and misleading newspaper talk—directly
to blame for losses and disappointments
to those foolish enough to pay heed to it.</p>

<p>Sherman’s country partners were not so rash
or so obstinate as he, and some of the coaches
he personally would have continued had been
withdrawn early in the railway advance. Among
those was the Manchester “Red Rover”; but
when the popular indignation against railway
delays and official insolence was thus exploited
by the newspapers, Sherman was enabled to again
secure the co-operation of his allies, and to put
that coach on the road once more. The decision
to do so was announced in a striking handbill:—</p>

<blockquote class="intact">

<p class="center vspace">“<span class="smcap larger">The Red Rover re-established</span><br />
throughout to Manchester.</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center"><i>Bull and Mouth Inn and Queen’s Hotel.</i></p>

<p>It is with much satisfaction that the Proprietors
of the <span class="smcap">Red Rover</span> Coach are enabled to
announce its</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap larger">Re-establishment</span></p>

<p class="in0">as a direct conveyance <span class="smcap">throughout, between
London and Manchester</span>, and that the arrangements
will be the same as those which before
obtained for it such entire and general approval.
In this effort the Proprietors anxiously hope that
the public will recognise and appreciate the desire
to supply an accommodation which will require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
and deserve the patronage and support of the
large and busy community on that line of road.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Red Rover</span> will start every evening, at a
quarter before seven, by way of</p>

<p class="in0 in6">

<p>It was a gallant effort, but failed. Manchester
men had grumbled at railway delays, but they
were not sentimentalists, and when the London
and Birmingham Railway was opened throughout,
and an uninterrupted run through to Manchester
was possible, they forsook the road, and the
“Red Rover” roved no more.</p>

<p>But still, sentiment gushed freely over the
coaches in every channel of the periodical press,
except, of course, in those railway journals that
even thus early had come into existence. Poetry,
of sorts, was lavished on the coachmen by the
bucketful, and they were made to consider themselves
martyrs in a lost cause. They felt themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
greatly honoured by all those attentions,
and now began to perceive that they were really
very fine fellows indeed. It was a proud position
they now occupied in the public eye, but it had
its own peculiar drawbacks. Amid all this adulation
they could not but see that they were like the
gladiators of ancient times, going forth to glory, it
is true, but to simultaneous extinction; and as all
the plaudits of the multitude must have seemed
to them a hollow mockery, so did this latter hero-worship
appear cheap and unsubstantial to the
coachmen. Some of them assumed a pensive air,
which did by no means sit well upon their burly
forms and purple countenances, and was often, to
their disgust, mistaken for indigestion.</p>

<p>Here, from among a wealth of verse, is a
typical ballad of the time, among the best of its
kind; but even so, perhaps not altogether one
that Tennyson would have been proud to father:—</p>

<p>On a few out-of-the-way routes, originally not
worth the while of railway companies to exploit,
coaching did, however, survive an incredible time.
Cordery in 1796 painted the even then old-established
Chesham coach, and coaches continued
to run into Buckinghamshire until quite recent
times. Aylesbury, Chesham, Amersham, and Wendover
only obtained direct railway accommodation
when the Metropolitan Railway, under the lead of
Sir Edward Watkin, extended into the country
past Harrow and Rickmansworth, reaching Aylesbury
in 1892. The Amersham and Wendover
coach—really better described as a three-horsed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
’bus—went to London daily until 1890, returning
from the “Old Bell,” Holborn, at five o’clock in
the evening. It was the sole survivor of the host
of coaches that left London fifty years earlier.</p>

<p>But two generations have passed away since
coaches began to disappear and to become historic,
and the “elderly man,” with his enviable
memories of a long journey in mid-spring or
autumn on the outside of a stage-coach, written
about by George Eliot, is no longer to be found,
reminiscent of the times that were. Nay, the
locomotive steam engine itself is doomed, in turn,
to be replaced by self-moving electric motor
carriages, and we shall live to drop a salt tear
upon an express locomotive retired from active
service, or to sigh at sight of a solitary Metropolitan
Railway engine placed in a museum of
things that were. The days of the prophets were
not ended with the Biblical prognosticators, with
Nixon, red-faced or otherwise, or with Mother
Shipton, or even with Erasmus Darwin, who,
although he could foresee steam and the balloon,
could not envisage electricity. They included
George Eliot, also, among the prophets, shadowing
forth, in a most remarkable way, the Central
London Railway and other tube lines of our own
time, in this extraordinary passage: “Posterity
may be shot, like a bullet, through a tube, by
atmospheric pressure ... but the slow, old-fashioned
way of getting from one end of our
country to the other is the better thing to have
in the memory. The tube journey can never lend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283<br /><a id="Page_284">284</a><br /><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
much to picture and narrative; it is as barren as
an exclamatory ‘O!’” How true! The scenery
on what the vulgar call the “Tuppenny Tube” is
distinctly uninteresting.</p>

<p>But Marian Evans had, you see, her limitations
as a diviner of things to be. Electricity
was not within her ken; she did not suspect the
steam-carriages of her youth would be reincarnated
as modern motor-cars. Yet, all the time,
they were simply laid by, and Gurney, Hancock,
and their fellows are justified in this our day.
Everything recurs, essentially the same as before,
with a complete revolution of the wheel of time,
and thus the Road has become itself again.</p>

<p>Will a time come when the day of the motor-car
will be looked back upon with that air of
regretful sentiment with which the vanished
Coaching Age is regarded? The rhythmic footfall
of the horses and the rattle of the bars, the
tootling of the “yard of tin” and the cheerful
circumstance that attends the progress of a well-appointed
coach, are things which have been, and
may still be, experienced in our time by those who
journey down the roads affected by the summer
coaches, to Brighton, St. Albans, and Virginia
Water; but as the Coaching Age itself has
passed away, these are only sentimental revivals.
The horseless carriages are upon us, and “going
strong,” alike in speed and scent. The odour of
the imperfectly-combusted petrol desecrates the
airs of the country-side. Already the length and
breadth of the land have been explored by them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
on roads good, bad and indifferent, hilly or flat;
and the characteristic rattle of their machinery
and the hoarse trumpeting of their cyclorns are
becoming familiar even to the rustics of Devon
and Somerset.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed, however, that skill in
driving is not so necessary now as in the days of
the spanking teams of coach-horses. The careful
coachman of old saved his horses over the road for
the long climbs and rugged places; he “sprung”
them perhaps on the level, and gave them a
“towelling” as a persuader to greater efforts
through snow-drifts, winds or floods; and the
driver of a motor-car does many of these things to
his machinery, not indeed with the aid of a whip,
but through the agency of levers, taps and brakes.
You can overdrive and exhaust a motor just as
easily as you can a horse, while it wants feeding
just as well. “A just man is merciful to his
beast,” and a cautious man is careful of his car,
not only because if he was not he would perhaps
be left with half a ton of inert machinery upon
the road, but because he is just as fond of his
automobile as many another of his steeds of flesh
and blood.</p>

<p>But to most people who have only seen motor-cars,
and have neither driven them nor ridden in
one, this will not readily be understood; while
the veteran who remembers the sights and sounds
of the coaching days does not hear the clatter of
the new occupants of the road with pleasurable
feelings. To him there is no music in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287<br /><a id="Page_288">288</a><br /><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
“Gurr-r-r-<em>umph</em>! bang, gr-rrr!” of a Daimler,
changing speeds in going uphill, nor any charm
in the rattle of a Benz; the “ft-ft-ft” of a motor-tricycle,
or the banshee-like minor-key wail,
“wow-wow-wow,” of an electric cab on wood
pavement. How very odd if there were!</p>

<p>Does it never occur to thinking men that the
“blessings” of invention and the age of mechanical
and other improvements have been too loudly and
consistently praised? We need not be thought
fanatically opposed to change if we deny the
reality of some of those blessings. Let it be
granted that they are ultimately in favour of the
community and for the eventual improvement of
the race; but if you view him unconventionally,
does not the inventor, with his ingenious devices
to overturn the practice and habits of generations
past, seem sometimes rather a curse than a
benefactor to mankind? While with one hand he
simplifies and cheapens something (whether it be
in travel or in anything else does not particularly
matter for argument’s sake), with the other he
sets a more strenuous pace to life. In the long
ago he invented printing; and the Devil, seeing
prophetically ahead, looked on with approval,
because he foresaw the halfpenny evening papers.
He introduced gas, replaced horses by steam-engines,
and away went the leisured pace of that
generation; and then, when a newer one was born
to take steam as a matter of course, brought
electricity to bear upon lighting and tractive problems.
Always he sets you a quicker pace when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
you would be going quietly or resting by the way.
One generation of him takes away the traffic of
the roads; another filches that of the railways
and puts the traffic on the road again in an
altered form. There is no finality about the inventor,
who ought, for the peace of the age, first
to be gently dissuaded, then admonished, and, in
the last resort, severely dealt with. Our ancestors
had a “quick way” with such, and discouraged
invention by putting inventors to death as wizards.
A drastic method, but they saved themselves much
worry and trouble thereby. The inventor is not
usually entitled to any consideration on the score
of working for the benefit of humanity. So little
does he do so that he takes infinite care to patent
and to provisionally protect even his immature
devices. He works, in short, to build his own
fortune.</p>

<p>Apply these feelings to the case of the coachmen
who were born in an age that knew nothing
of steam. Every stand-by was rooted up in the
coming of railways, and the steam-engine was just
as strange a monster to them as the electric
dynamo is to many of ourselves. Often they could
not transfer their allegiance to the railway, even
though they starved. It was not always stubbornness
or pride that held them aloof, but a certain
and easily-understood lack of adaptability that
forbade one who had held the reins to handle
the starting-lever of the locomotive. More guards
than coachmen transferred themselves from the
road to the rail, because the duties were not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
diverse; but, although there were coachmen who
took positions on railways, no one has ever heard
of one who became an engine-driver.</p>

<p>But coachmen and guards and the passengers
they drove are all passed away, and the world
rolls on as though they had never existed. The
coaches, like the old Manchester “Defiance,”
shown in the picture, rotting away in the deserted
inn-yard, were left to decay in unconsidered places
or were reduced to firewood; unlike many of the
old “Bull and Mouth” mails, which, after lying
there for some time idle, were bought and shipped
to Spain, running for many years on Peninsula
roads, from Malaga in the south to Vittoria and
Salamanca in the north, and by a singular fate
visiting in their old age those blood-red fields
of victory whose fame they had once spread from
London all over triumphant England.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Steam, James Watt, and George Stephenson have a great deal
to answer for. They will ruin the breed of horses, as they have
already ruined the innkeepers and the coachmen, many of whom
have already been obliged to seek relief at the poor-house, or have
died in penury and want.”—<cite>The Times</cite>, 1839.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 in0"><span class="smcap">“Where,”</span> asked Thackeray in <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>,
“where is the road now, and its merry incidents
of life? Is there no Chelsea or Greenwich for
the honest, pimple-nosed coachmen?” No, there
was not. The action of Parliament in sanctioning
so many railways in so short a space of time,
without making any legislative restriction or provision
in favour of the coachmen whose careers
were ruined by railways, seems strange to the
present generation, but in no single instance were
they considered. The greatest and swiftest revolution
ever brought about in the methods and
habits of travelling took place in the short period
of time between 1837, when the effect of railways
first began to be felt, and 1848, when most of the
great main lines were opened. Eleven years is no
great space in which to effect so sweeping a change,
and it is not surprising that ruin and misery were
wrought by it, not among coachmen alone, but
dealt out impartially to every one of the many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293<br /><a id="Page_294">294</a><br /><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
people and interests whose prosperity was bound
up with the continuance of the old order of things.
Coachmen were by no means the greatest sufferers:
others felt the blow as severely, but in this chapter
we have no concern with the great army of innkeepers,
ostlers, post-boys and stable-helpers who
so suddenly found their occupation taken away
and no new means of livelihood provided.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After H. Alken.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>What became of the coachmen? In the vast
majority of cases we do not, and cannot, know;
for if one thing be more certain than another,
it is that we are better informed in classic and
mediæval lore than in the story of our forbears
of two or three generations ago, and that most
of the papers and documents necessary to a full
and particular history of coaching have been
destroyed.</p>

<p>Many among those not born in the age of
coaches have marvelled at what they consider the
wealth of reminiscences about the old coachmen.
The truth is that there exists no such wealth.
There were certainly no fewer than three thousand
coachmen throughout the country in the days just
before railways. What do we know of them?
Very little. Even their names have been forgotten,
except in some (comparatively few) special
cases. No one can give us a complete list of
the coachmen of the Edinburgh Mail, of the
Exeter “Telegraph,” or Devonport “Quicksilver,”
or of any of the crack day coaches. Nearly
complete in some cases, but never quite, because
the reminiscent travellers by famous mail or stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
have never troubled to detail such things; caring
only to narrate the peculiarly bad or good coachmanship,
as the case might be, or the eccentricities
in manner or dress, of the men who drove them.
The merely efficient coachman, with no salient
characteristics to be described enthusiastically or
spitefully caricatured, stood little chance of notice
in print. He drove until the natural end of his
career came, or until it was cut short by the
railway; and in either case ended obscurely.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the noted masters of the
art of driving a coach, who taught the young
bloods that accomplishment, or who were excellent
companions with joke and song to while the
hours away, have found abundant notice; and
they are the chronicles of these men that make
that apparent wealth of reminiscence.</p>

<p>The coachmen ended, as may be supposed,
very variously. A generation ago, many of the
city and suburban omnibuses were driven by
gloomy, purple-faced men, confirmed misanthropes,
who viewed the world with jaundiced eyes, and,
living in vivid recollection of the past, despised
themselves, their omnibuses, and the people they
drove. Those were the old coachmen. The
Richmond Conveyance Company, whose omnibuses
in the ’sixties conveyed many Londoners between
the “Goose and Gridiron,” St. Paul’s Churchyard,
and that famous riverside town, employed a
number of old-time coachmen, who wore tall
hats with a gold band, and were never tired
of telling their box-seat passengers about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297<br /><a id="Page_298">298</a><br /><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
open-handedness of the passengers of old, and incidentally
that travellers by ’bus were “not worth
a d——n”; not, perhaps, a tactful or ingratiating
manner, but “out of the fulness of the heart the
mouth speaketh.”</p>

<p>When the London and South-Western Railway
was opened to Richmond, in 1843, the first station-master
was a former coachman and coach-proprietor,
and a very notable one: no less a man,
indeed, than Thomas Cooper, who had in his
time run a service of coaches between London,
Bath and Bristol, and had been landlord of that
very fine old inn, the “Castle,” at Marlborough,
now and for many years past a part of Marlborough
College. Cooper’s varied enterprises on
the Bath Road at last led him direct into the
Bankruptcy Court. When he emerged from the
official whitewashing process, Chaplin had acquired
his line of coaches, and to that highly successful
man he became a local manager. It was Chaplin
who obtained him the position of station-master,
as doubtless he had, in his influential position
of director and chairman of the L. &amp; S.W.R.,
already found many posts on that line for
coachmen, guards, and others.</p>

<p>Jo Walton, the famous whip of the “Star
of Cambridge,” became a messenger at Foster’s
Bank in that town, after the railway had run
him off. At an earlier date Dick Vaughan, of
the Cambridge “Telegraph,” had been killed by
being thrown out of a gig; but of him we know
little. Of Thomas Cross, who was intimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
connected with Cambridge, we know a good deal.
He drove the Lynn “Union” for many years.
Born in 1791, he died in 1877, in his eighty-sixth
year. His occupancy of the box-seat lasted
from 1821 to 1847, when his coaching career
was brought to a close by the opening of the
length of railway between Cambridge, Ely, and
King’s Lynn, His was a remarkable history.
His father, John Cross, from being a highly
prosperous coach-proprietor, with large estates
and considerable social standing in the district
between Petersfield and Portsmouth, was gradually
brought low by misfortune and reckless speculations.
John Cross, with the wealth and status of
a country squire, had given his son Thomas an
excellent education, and had destined him for
the Navy; but serious attacks of epilepsy, and
the results of an accident caused from falling
in one of these fits on a number of wine-bottles,
cut his career in the Service short. He was a
midshipman when these distressing circumstances
entirely altered his future. He then started
farming, but misfortune dogged his steps. As
owners of horses, himself and his father fared
no better, for the terrible disease of glanders
broke out and quickly carried off 120 animals.
Eventually ruin faced the family, and Thomas
Cross at last was reduced to seeking employment
as a whip in the very yard once owned by his
father. At the age of thirty, then, married and
with a family of his own to support, we perceive
him pretty thoroughly graduated in the school of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
life, and already familiar with the worst blows
that adversity
could give. In
the beginning of
his coaching career
he drove the
“Union” between
London and Cambridge,
but at
different periods
had the middle
and the lower
ground.</p>

DICK VAUGHAN OF THE CAMBRIDGE
“TELEGRAPH.”</p>
<p class="p0 fright"><i>From an etching by Robert Dighton, 1809.</i>
</p></div></div>

<p class="p2">He was not
altogether a genial
coachman, and
held little intercourse
with his
brethren of the
bench, to whom
he considered himself,
as indeed he
was, superior. It
was not, however,
a judicious attitude
to adopt, and
those who drove
the “Star” and
“Telegraph” Cambridge
coaches—Jo
Walton, James
Reynolds, and others—retorted by describing him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
as an indifferent whip. Perhaps, in fact, he
was, but the “Lynn Union” was never a dashing
coach, and gave no opportunity of displaying the
skill demanded on others.</p>

<p>Tommy Cross was never so pleased as when he
could pick up a box-seat passenger well grounded
in the classics, or interested in poetry—for poetry
first, and the classics afterwards, engaged his
thoughts. He drove four-in-hand all day, and
when his day’s work was done retired to some
solitary chamber and mounted Pegasus, who
carried him on the wings of the wind to the unearthly
regions where dwell the spirits of Homer
and Virgil. In short, he seems altogether to have
lived a fine confused unpractical life, reflected to
some degree in his book, <i>The Autobiography of a
Stage-Coachman</i>, an interesting but formless work,
so lacking in arrangement that it is difficult from
its pages to gain any very clear view of his career,
and actually impossible from it to discover what
was the name of the Lynn coach he drove and so
constantly mentions. That it was the “Union”
only independent inquiries disclose. The name
“Union” must in later years have taken an
equivocal and prophetic meaning to poor Thomas,
for, like many another coachman, he saw with
apprehension railways building all over the country
and running the coaches off successive roads. He
knew his own turn must come, and was early
seized with fears for the future. In 1843 he
published, at Cambridge, in pamphlet form, some
verses in imitation of Gray’s <i>Elegy in a Country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303<br /><a id="Page_304">304</a><br /><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Churchyard</i>. He called it <i>The Lament and
Anticipation of a Stage-Coachman</i>. It was, indeed,
a very doleful production, describing what
was already happening on other roads and was
presently to befall on this. It is not proposed
to quote the sixteen pages of this poetical effort.
Let two verses suffice to show at once how, if his
Muse did limp unmistakably, she was not wholly
destitute of descriptive force:—</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The end was not yet, but the Lynn “Union”
was off the road in 1847, and Cross could not
obtain any form of employment on the railway.
He had already, in 1846, petitioned Parliament,
but without avail; and now entered upon those
unhappy years in which he eked out a precarious
existence on the occasional aid given him by such
men as Henry Villebois, the good-hearted Norfolk
sporting squire, and others who had often been
passengers on the box-seat of the “Union.” In
those years he published several pieces in verse,
generally cast in the ambitious epic form. Unfortunately,
he was not the poet he thought
himself, and they are rather turgid and bombastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
specimens of blank verse. He planned and wrote
a <i>History of Coaching</i>, but in the bankruptcy of
his printers the manuscript disappeared, and so
what might have proved a really valuable work
was lost. At last, in 1865, he found a home in
Huggens’ College, a charitable institution at
Northfleet, founded and endowed some twenty
years earlier by a wealthy City merchant for
gentlemen reduced to poor circumstances. This
testimony to his social superiority above other
coachmen seems to have cheered and invigorated
him amazingly, for he was a collegian at Huggens’
beneficent institution for twelve years, and lived
to be nearly eighty-six years of age.</p>

<p>Less fortunate was Jack Peer, or Peers, of the
Southampton “Telegraph,” famous in his day, but
reduced to driving an omnibus, and thence, being
morose and quarrelsome in that position, by degrees
to the workhouse. His unhappy situation
became known to a gentleman who had often
travelled by him in brighter times: a handsome
subscription was raised, and he was at least
enabled to end his days in quiet retirement.</p>

<p>A great many ex-coachmen became innkeepers
and publicans. Among these was Ambrose Pickett,
of the Brighton “Union” and “Item,” who
anticipated the end of Brighton coaching in 1841,
by becoming landlord of an inn in North Street,
with the very appropriate sign of the “Coach and
Horses.”</p>

<p>A much more famous coachman than he—Sam
Hayward, of the Shrewsbury “Wonder”—followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Mr. Weller’s example, and married a widow, landlady
of the “Raven and Bell,” on Wyle Cop; but
he did not long survive the extinction of “the
Road,” and the widow soon found herself again in
that situation. John Jobson, who for many years
drove the “Prince of Wales”—the “Old Prince,”
as it was familiarly called—a London, Oxford and
Birmingham coach, continued on to Shrewsbury
and Holyhead—became a coach-proprietor, established
at the “Talbot,” Shrewsbury, and a thorn
in the side of Isaac Taylor, of the neighbouring
“Lion.” Coaching came to an end at Shrewsbury
in 1842, and the name of Jobson was heard no
more.</p>

<p>Many coachmen were killed off the box in the
exercise of their profession, as, in the chapter on
accidents, has already been shown. A considerable
number, secure in the affection of the
wealthy amateurs, many of whom they had
taught the art of driving, entered the service of
those noblemen and gentlemen, in some horsy or
stable capacity. The eighth Duke of Beaufort,
one of the Sir Watkin Williams Wynns, and
others, thus found employment for these refugees
of the road, and continually aided many more;
but something in the long overlordship they had
exercised over four horses, and a good deal more
perhaps in that hero-worship down the road, of
which Washington Irving writes, had spoiled
them. Their lives would not run sweetly in
fresh grooves. They could not, or would not, take
to new employments, and even, subsisting upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
charity, were often absurdly haughty, insolent,
and insufferable. Like horses, good living, coupled
with little exercise, rendered them unmanageable,
and they not infrequently quarrelled with the
hand that fed them. “What do <em>you</em> know about
throat-lashings and head-terrets?” contemptuously
asked Harry Simpson, ex-coachman of the Devonport
“Quicksilver,” of Sir Watkin Williams
Wynn, who, before him, had been holding forth
to some of his guests upon the respective merits
of those harnessing methods in the old coaching
days. “Nothing practically,” answered the good-humoured
baronet; “my ideas are only ideas.
But you know all about the subject: let us have
the benefit of a professional view.”</p>

<p>At this time Harry Simpson—“Little Harry,”
as he was called, undersized and “looking like
a tomtit on a round of beef when on the driving-box”—was
stud-groom to that Welsh landowner,
who, from compassion, had taken him into his
employ when coaching failed. “Little Harry,”
domineering and wilful as he was, remained in
his service for thirty years, and died in 1886.</p>

<p>Some of the undoubted veterans of the old
order lived to patriarchal ages, and when they
died their obituary notices confounded many a
writer who had lightly declared, years before,
that the last of the coachmen was dead.</p>

<p>Matthew Marsh, who for many years drove
the Maidstone “Times,” had been a private
soldier in the 14th Foot, and fought and was
wounded at Waterloo. He was generally averse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309<br /><a id="Page_310">310</a><br /><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
from mentioning that fact, but one day, hearing
from his box a dispute about the battlefield in
which both disputants were in error, he corrected
them, simply adding, “I happened to be there.”
He died in 1887, aged ninety-four years, aided
in his declining days by the Earl of Albemarle,
who had fought in the same campaign.</p>

<p>William Clements, of Canterbury, who had
driven the “Tally-Ho” and “Eagle” coaches
between Canterbury and London before the nineteenth
century had grown out of its teens, died
in 1891, aged ninety-one. He was “the last of
the coachmen,” yet, two years later, in the early
part of 1893, we find the death recorded of Philip
(commonly called “Tim”) Carter, aged eighty-eight.
He it was who drove the “Red Rover”
on June 19th, 1831, from the “Elephant and
Castle” to Brighton in 4 hours 21 minutes—a
pace then greatly in excess of anything before
accomplished on that road. The occasion was
the opening of William IV.’s first Parliament,
and the haste was for the double purpose of
speedily carrying the King’s Speech to Brighton
and of advertising the “Red Rover” itself, then
a newly-established coach. He did not run light,
as many of the record-making coaches used, but
carried fourteen passengers on that trip.</p>

<p>A year after Carter’s death Harry Ward passed
away, August 4th, 1894, aged eighty-one. He
was one of a family of ten, and the last, except
his elder brother Charles, of whom mention will
presently be made. Their father had himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
been a coachman on the Exeter Road, and lived
at Overton at the time Charles was born. He
afterwards became landlord of the “White Hart,”
Hartford Bridge, on the same great highway,
eighteen miles nearer London. Harry Ward’s
career is partly told on page 247, Vol. I. In
after years he drove coaches started in the revival
on the Brighton Road and elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Last,” it was again said, of the coachmen who
drove the famous coaches up to the time when
railways ran them off the road, was Charles S.
Ward, elder brother of the above. He was born
in 1810, and died in his eighty-ninth year,
December 9th, 1899. His was an interesting
career. Son of one who had been a small proprietor
as well as coachman, and thus familiar
from his birth with horses, he was driving the
Ipswich and Norwich Mail as far as Colchester
at the early age of seventeen, and was thus
probably the youngest coachman ever entrusted
with the conduct of a mail on any road. But
he drove it for nearly five years without an
accident, and was then promoted to the Devonport
“Quicksilver,” at that time the fastest
out of London, nightly driving the 29 miles
to Bagshot, and then back, in the small hours
of the morning, with the up-coach. After nearly
seven years of this night-work, trying and
monotonous even in summer, but extremely
hazardous in winter, he sought a change, and
applied to Chaplin, who was the proprietor of
the “Quicksilver,” for day-work. The very fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
of his being so sure and safe a coachman on
the night mail operated at first against his being
transferred to a coach not calling in so great a
degree for those qualities, but in 1838 he obtained
the offer of the Brighton Day Mail, which Chaplin
was about to start, together with the chance of
horsing it a stage. Like many coachmen, ambitious
of becoming a proprietor, Ward closed
with this offer, but the Day Mail did not load
well, and he soon gave up his share. He might
have known that Chaplin, so keen a business man,
was not precisely the person to offer any one else
a share worth retaining.</p>

<p>Ward then left Chaplin, and went over to the
Exeter “Telegraph,” the fast day coach run by
Mrs. Ann Nelson, in opposition to Chaplin’s
“Quicksilver Mail.” Mrs. Nelson was glad to
get so steady a whip as Ward, who for three
years from this time drove the “Telegraph”
daily between Exeter and Ilminster, a double
journey of 66 miles. In 1841 the Bristol and
Exeter Railway, a continuation of the Great
Western, was opened as far as Bridgewater, and,
by consequence, the “Telegraph” was withdrawn
by Mrs. Nelson and her co-partners. Ward,
however, held on, and, with the coachman on
the other side of his stage and the two guards,
extended the journey at one end as the railway
cut it short at the other. From 1841 to
April 30th, 1844, the “Telegraph” therefore
ran the 95 miles between Bridgewater and
Devonport, taking up the railway passengers at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
the former place. On May 1st, 1844, the railway
was opened to Exeter, and the journey of the
poor old “Telegraph” was cut down to 50 miles.
But those were spirited times, and even then,
driven thus into the West, there were competing
coaches. A “Nonpareil” Bristol and
Devonport coach had been running daily at the
same hours as the “Telegraph,” but was taken
off, and a “Tally-Ho” put on the shorter Exeter
and Devonport trip. <em>Then</em> the racing became
furious. Up out of Exeter, on to the breezy
heights of Haldon, and by the skirts of Dartmoor
the two coaches sped—the “Telegraph,” as Ward
tells us in his reminiscences, always leading.
Several times they did the 50 miles in 3 hours
20 minutes, and for months together never
exceeded 4 hours!</p>

<p>That mad pace could not last; and so, as
neither could run the other off the road, they
agreed to keep it amicably for so long as the
railway, pushing irresistibly onward, would suffer
them to exist. On May 1st, 1848, the South
Devon Railway was opened to Plymouth, and
it seemed as though coaching in the West of
England was quite killed; but a number of
Cornish gentlemen approaching Ward with the
proposal that he should start a fast coach into
Cornwall, and promising to support it, he put
a “Tally-Ho” on the road between Plymouth,
Truro and Falmouth, a distance of 62 miles.
He was so fortunate as to be offered the
contract for carrying the mail between those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
places, and the “Tally-Ho” was converted into a
mail, and ran for a number of years until the
railway was opened to Truro, in May 1859.
Then, and then only, did Ward’s career as a
coachman end, for although for some years, being
proprietor, he had seldom driven, he had not
hitherto deserted the box-seat, despite the calls
upon his time of the horse-mart and driving-school
business he had meanwhile established at
Plymouth.</p>

<p>Charles Ward, more fortunate, more businesslike
and far-seeing than the majority of his
fellows, ended as the prosperous proprietor of
livery stables in the Brompton Road, in whose
yard he might be seen on sunny days during his
last years sitting on a bench against the warm
brick wall, and dozing the afternoons away.</p>

<p>Even as this page is written, in January 1903,
another old coachman—again “the last”!—has
died. This was Sampson Brewer, who, living
in his later years at Cedar Cottage, Vancouver,
declared himself to be the last survivor of the
old coaching days. Born in 1809, he was, therefore,
ninety-four years of age at his death.
He said he drove on its final journey “the last
regularly-running mail in England”: that between
Plymouth and Falmouth, by way of Liskeard and
St. Austell. He must thus have been in the
employ of Charles Ward.</p>

<p>A STAGE COACHMAN’S EPITAPH AT HADDISCOE.</p></div></div>

<p>Two, at least, of the coachmen committed
suicide. One of these was Dick Vickers, who had
driven the Holyhead Mail. In an evil hour he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
resigned the ribbons to indulge a fancy he had
nursed of becoming a farmer. But farming was
beyond him: he lost all his money at it, and
hanged himself in one of his own barns at Tynant,
near Corwen. Charles Holmes, for more than
twenty years coachman and part-proprietor of the
“Old Blenheim” London, Oxford and Woodstock
coach, and the recipient in 1835 of a handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
present of silver plate, subscribed for by Sir Henry
Peyton and many other gentlemen, committed
suicide by throwing himself off a steamer into
the Thames.</p>

<p>The question, “What became of the coachmen?”
is partly answered in the subjoined collection
of epitaphs and eulogies got together from
far and near. First comes the early and curious
one at Haddiscoe, near Lowestoft, to William
Salter, said to have lost his life by falling from his
coach at the foot of the hill near the churchyard,
shown on the page opposite.</p>

<p>To this succeeds the highly interesting example
in Over Wallop churchyard, Hampshire, to Skinner,
the coachman of the Auxiliary Mail, upset at
Middle Wallop, on the Exeter Road, by one of
the wheels coming off. Skinner was killed on the
spot, and the passengers injured. The inscription
<span class="locked">runs:—</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">
Sacred<br />
to the Memory of<br />
HENRY SKINNER, a Coachman,<br />
who was killed near this place<br />
July 13th, 1814,<br />
Aged 35 years.

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">And stopt the course of my machine.<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="in0">Then comes a Latin passage:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p class="in0">It may be translated:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While I was conveying various passengers with the greatest skill, Black Death intervened—<br /></span>

</div>

<p>An epitaph is (or was, for most of the stones in
late years have been cleared away) in Winchester
Cathedral yard to the last coachman of the Winchester
and Southampton stage, but no record of
it has been found.</p>

<p>Far away, in South Shropshire, on the north
side of St. Lawrence’s churchyard, Ludlow,
lies John Abingdon, who died in 1817, and who,
according to his epitaph, “for forty years drove
the Ludlow coach to London; a trusty servant, a
careful driver, and an honest man.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His labour done, no more to town<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till Christ shall call him with the blest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To heavenly realms above.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the same district, in the pretty churchyard
of Stanton Lacy, may be found a stone to the
memory of John Wilkes, of the Worcester and
Ludlow Mail, killed in 1803 by its overturning
in a flood. Some poetic friend inscribed this
tribute:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! poor Wilkes, swift down the winding hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horses plunged into the fatal rill.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Wilkes was flung into the foaming spate.<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then there is the epitaph on the driver of the
coach that ran between Aylesbury and London,
written by the Rev. H. Bullen, vicar of Dunton,
in whose churchyard he is laid:—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Thy last account may prove exact and just.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May He who drives the chariot of the day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where travellers, like yourself, of every age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every clime, have taken their last stage—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God of mercy and the God of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Show you the road” to Paradise above.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The old whips had a whimsical way with
them, and sometimes not a little pathetic as well.
The road was not only the profession whence they
drew their living, but it was their passion—their
whole life. Thus, when a noted chaise-driver at
Lichfield, one Jack Lewton, died in 1796, he was,
at his last request, carried from the “Bald Buck”
in that city by six chaise-drivers in scarlet jackets
and buckskin breeches—the pall supported by six
ostlers from the different inns. The funeral took
place on August 22nd, in St. Michael’s churchyard,
as near the turnpike road as possible; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
that he might, as he said, enjoy the satisfaction
of hearing his brother whips pass and repass.</p>

<p>Similar directions are said to have been left
by Luke Kent, reputed to have been the first
guard ever appointed to a mail-coach. The story
goes that he was buried at Farlington, near
Portsmouth, on the Chichester Road, and left an
annual bequest to his successors on the Chichester
coach, on condition that they should always sound
their horns when passing the place of his interment.
Diligent inquiry, however, does not disclose
the fact of any one of that name lying at
Farlington; but a Francis Faulkner, who died
at Petersfield, May 18th, 1870, aged eighty-four
years, lies in a vault in Farlington churchyard.
He was a guard on the “Rocket” London and
Portsmouth coach, and local gossip still tells
that he left a request (perhaps also a bequest)
that if ever stage-coaches should pass his vault,
their horns should be sounded. Certainly, a few
years ago, when a coach was run from Brighton
to Portsmouth, its horn was always sounded on
passing the churchyard.</p>

<p>A conclusion shall be made with the eulogy
of Robert Pointer, coachman on the Lewes stage,
which he is said to have driven thirty years
without an accident. It does not appear what
relation he was to the one-time famous “Bob
Pointer,” of the Oxford Road, and in 1834 on
the Brighton “Quicksilver”—a favourite coaching
tutor. <em>That</em> Bob Pointer, according to the Duke
of Beaufort, could always be depended on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
start sober, but the horses had to be changed on
the way anywhere but at public-houses, if it was
desired that he should end his journey in the
same condition:—</p>

<span class="subhead">THE OLD ENGLAND OF COACHING DAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">This</span> is the time, now that we have passed the
threshold of a new era, when old landmarks are
disappearing everywhere around us as we gaze,
and the Old England that we have known is
being dispossessed and disestablished by a new
and strange, an inhospitable and alien England
of foreign plutocrats—this is the psychological
moment for a brief review of what this England
of ours was like in the old days of stage-coach
and mail.</p>

<p>If we could recapture those times we should
find them spacious days, of much fresh air,
illimitable horizons, a great deal of solid, unostentatious
comfort for the stay-at-homes, and
also of much discomfort for the traveller; but
although no sensible person, fully informed of
the conditions of life in the long ago, would wish
he had been born into those times, yet among
their disadvantages and the discomforts incidental
to travel scarce more than two generations ago,
there were to be found, as a matter of course, not
a few things which would be looked upon with
rapture by the modern sentimentalist. That was
the era when the Suburb was unknown anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
else than around London, and even London’s
suburbs were sparse, scattered, sporadic, and
separated by great distances from one another.
Taking coach from the City, where the merchants
and the shopkeepers commonly lived over their
business premises, you came presently, north,
south, east, or west, through suburban Stamford
Hill, Sydenham, Clapton, or Kensington, to rural
Edmonton, Croydon, Romford, or Chiswick, and
so presently to the Unknown. <em>That</em> was, of
itself, a charm in the old order of things—a
charm lost long since in these crowded times,
when constant and intimate travel have made
us familiar with distant towns, and by consequence
incurious and incapable of surprises.
Everything is known, if not at the first hand
of personal observation, at least by proxy of
our reading in guide-book history, or by the
debilitating photograph, which leaves nothing to
the imagination, and renders us travelled in the
uttermost nooks and corners of the land, even
though we be bedridden, or thoroughgoing
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitués</i> of the armchair and the fireside. The
picture-postcard—the lowest common denominator
of the photograph—has come to give the
last touch of satiety, the final revulsion of repletion.
The Land’s End has long since been
exploited, John o’ Groat’s is merely at the end
of a cycle ride, the “bottomless” caverns of
the Peak have been plumbed, every unscalable
mountain climbed. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Connu!</i>” we exclaim when
we are told any fact. No surprises are left.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
We may never before have journeyed to Edinburgh,
but photographs have rendered us so long
familiar with its castle and rock that we
cannot recollect a time when we were not familiar
with the physical geography of the “modern
Athens,” and we seem to have been born with
a knowledge of the geographical peculiarities of
every other place. We are, therefore, naturally
bored and unresponsive in situations where our
grandfathers were surprised and delighted; but
although possessed thereby with a profound
dissatisfaction with ourselves, we cannot hope
to win back to the unsophisticated joys of old
time.</p>

<p>Would that it could be done! The wish is
everywhere evident, but only Lethean waters could
sweep away the useless lumber of mental baggage
that destroys imagination and blunts the senses.
The many efforts made to bring back the “properties”—to
speak in the theatrical sense—of
old time are pitiful or ridiculous, as your humour
wills it. These are the days when things quaint
and old-fashioned are revived for sake of their
quaintness, sometimes in spite of their inconvenience
and unsuitability; when ingle-nooks
and open hearths with fire-dogs are built into
modern houses for effect, although slow-combustion
stoves are infinitely more comfortable
and less wasteful of fuel. Our forbears, who
did not know slow-combustion stoves, were not
the creatures of sentiment that we are, and
would soon have abolished open hearths for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
close stoves had they been given the chance,
just as they would have exchanged the tallow
dip for electric lighting had the opportunity
offered. We do not know the feelings with
which the first gentlemen to use carpets abolished
the old rush-strewn halls and the manners and
customs contemporary with them; but if their
sense of smell was as acute as our own, they must
have noticed with great relief the absence of the
dirt and festering bones that found a hiding-place
beneath those rushes. All the marvellous changes
in habits of living—the cheapening of food,
the conversion of the luxuries of a former age
into the ordinary requirements of this, and even
the alterations in the face of the country and the
houses of towns and villages—are due to those
increased facilities of intercourse which, owing to
the gradual improvement in roads, the coaches
and waggons of yore were first able to give.
When public vehicles began to ply into the
country, this England of ours was not only a land
of wide unenclosed heaths and commons, but the
people of one county—nay, even the inhabitants
of towns and villages—were markedly different
in thought and prejudices, in speech and clothing,
from those of others; while local style in building,
and the various building materials obtained locally,
gave each successive place that appearance of
something new and strange which the traveller
does not always meet with nowadays in far distant
lands. As the drainage of lakes and fens, the filling
up of the valleys and the reduction of the hills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
have quite revolutionised the physical geography
of wide areas, often changing the natural history
of the districts affected, so has cheap, constant
and quick travelling and conveyance of materials
helped to reduce places and people to one dead
level. Romance flies abashed from the level,
monotonous road, where, years before, in some
darkling hollow between the hills, ringed in by
dense woodlands, it lurked in company with the
highwayman. We do not desire the return of
those gentry, but what would literature have done
without them? Highway and turnpike improvements
long ago sliced off the most aspiring hilltops,
and, carrying the roads through cuttings,
used the material thus cut away for the purpose
of filling up the gullies and deep depressions.
Where the early coaches toiled, often axle-deep,
through the watersplashes formed by the little
rills and streams that ran athwart the way, later
generations have built bridges, or have done things
infinitely worse; so that a watersplash has become
a rare and curious object, noteworthy in a day’s
journey. Only recently, on the Dover Road, near
Faversham, has such a watersplash—one of the
most picturesque in the country—been abolished.
Ospringe was a little Kentish Venice, with a
clear-running shallow stream occupying the whole
of the roadway, with raised footpaths for pedestrians
at either side, and ancient gabled cottages
looking down upon the pretty scene. Alas! the
sparkling stream now goes under the road, in a pipe.</p>

<p>In the old days, no traveller going north along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
the Great North Road left Alconbury without first
seeing that the priming of his pistols was in order,
while the passengers by mail or stage secretly put
their watches and jewellery between their skin
and their underclothing, or deposited their purses
in their boots, before the coach topped Alconbury
Hill. For at “Aukenbury,” as Ogilby in his old
road-maps styles it, you were on the threshold of
a robbing-place only less famous than Gad’s Hill,
near Rochester, or those other notorious dark or
daylight lurks (for day or night mattered little
in those times), Hounslow Heath and Finchley
Common. The name of this ill-reputed place was
“Stonegate Hole.” It is marked distinctly on
the maps of Ogilby and his successors, between
the sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth milestones from
London, by the Old North Road, measured from
Shoreditch, and passing through Ware, Royston,
and Caxton.</p>

<p>Passing Papworth Everard, you came in those
days, on the left hand, just before reaching the
fifty-sixth milestone, to “Beggar’s Bush,” where
you probably saw the tramps, vagrants and footpads
of that age skulking, on the chance of robbing
some traveller unable to take care of himself.
Here, in sight of these wretches, you ostentatiously
toyed with your pistol holsters, or loosened your
sword in its scabbard, and so passed on scathless.
On leaving Alconbury, however, the horseman
generally preferred company, because the highwaymen
of Stonegate Hole were well armed, and, by
consequence, courageous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
What, exactly, was Stonegate, or Stangate,
Hole? It was the deep and solitary hollow that
then existed at the foot of the northward slope
of Alconbury Hill, known now as Stangate Hill.
The name derived from this road being a part of
the old Roman “Ermine Street,” formerly a stone-paved
way, and the “Hole” was formed by a rise
that immediately succeeded the descent. Quite
shut in by dense woods, it was an ideal spot for
highway robbery. When, in the later coaching
era, the road was lowered through the crest of
the hill, and the earth was used to raise it in the
hollow, Stonegate Hole disappeared. Bones were
found during the progress of the works, supposed
relics of unfortunate travellers who had met their
death at the hands of the highwaymen. A more
or less true story was long told of an ostler of the
“Wheatsheaf,” the inn that once stood on the hilltop.
He, it seems, used to help in putting in the
coach-horses when the teams were changed, and
would then take a short cut across the fields, and
be ready for the coach when it came down the
road. The coachman, guard, and passengers, who
did not know that the shining pistol-barrel he
levelled at them was really a tin candlestick, were
duly impressed by it, and yielded their valuables
accordingly.</p>

<p>A tale used to be told of one of the old
“London riders,” or “bagmen,” who lay at the
“Wheatsheaf” overnight and set forth the next
morning. His saddle-bags were full, and so
weighted with samples of his wares that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
scarce sit his horse, and had to be helped into the
saddle by an ostler. Once up, his eyes only with
difficulty peered over this mountainous weight,
but in this manner he set forth. He had not gone
far before he thought he had lost his way, when
fortunately he perceived another horseman, and
hailed him. The stranger took no notice; and so
our traveller ranged up alongside him with the
question. Instead of replying, the stranger thrust
his hand into his breast-pocket and withdrew what
the traveller imagined to be a pistol. Recollections
of the evil repute of the place suddenly
rushed into the traveller’s mind, and, putting
spurs to his horse, he dashed away from the
supposed highwayman, and did not draw rein
until in the neighbourhood of Huntingdon.</p>

<p>There he met a party of horsemen, who determined
to hunt the highwayman down, and so,
with the traveller, hurried on to Stonegate.
“There he is!” cried the traveller, as they came
in view of a peaceful-looking equestrian, ambling
gently along.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, sir,” said one of the party:
“that is our Mayor, the Mayor of Huntingdon.”</p>

<p>But the bagman asserted he was right, and so,
to end the dispute, the whole party rode up, and
one wished “Mr. Mayor” good morning. It was
indeed that worthy man, and although he again,
instead of making answer, drew something from
his pocket, it produced no alarm among his fellow-burgesses,
for <em>they</em> at least knew him for a very
deaf man, and had often seen him reach for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
ear-trumpet which he now drew forth, clapped to
his ear, and asked them what it was they said.</p>

<p>Swift, who, travelling between London, Chester,
Holyhead and Dublin, remarked upon the many
nations and strange peoples he passed on the way,
serves to emphasise these notes upon the fading
individuality of places and people. The dialect
of “Zummerzet” has not wholly decayed, but it
has become so modified that when old references
to its Bœotian nature are found, the reader who
knows modern Somerset, and does not consider
these changes, concludes that its grotesque speech
was greatly exaggerated; just as he cannot be
made to implicitly believe the remarkable and
oft-repeated story told by William Hutton of the
visit of himself and a friend to Bosworth in 1770,
when the people set the dogs at them, for the only
reason that they were strangers; or that other
tale of the savagery of the Lancashire and Yorkshire
villagers, who, when a person unknown to
them appeared, conversed as follow:—</p>

<p>“Dost knaw ’im?”</p>

<p>“Naya.”</p>

<p>“Is’t a straunger?”</p>

<p>“Ay, for sewer.”</p>

<p>“Then pause ’im; ’eave a stone at ’un; fettle
’im.”</p>

<p>No inoffensive stranger in country districts is
likely to meet with that reception nowadays. The
stranger in those times was regarded, as he generally
is in savage countries, as necessarily an
enemy; but travel has changed all that, and it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
been reserved for the London “hooligan,” who
has been taught better, to perpetrate, in the very
centre of civilisation, the barbarous methods of the
uninstructed peasantry of generations ago.</p>

<p>Stories like these are only incredible when the
circumstances of the age are unknown. In times
when a stranger might easily enough prove to be a
highwayman, or at the very least, some Government
emissary intent upon collecting hearth-money,
window-tax, or one of the very many
duties then levied upon necessaries of life, a
strange face might be that of an enemy, and at
any rate was unlikely to be that of a friend.
Sightseers were unknown. No one stirred from
home if he could find an excuse for staying by his
own fireside. “What do you want here?” asked
the Welsh peasants of the earliest tourists; and
declined to believe them when they said they
journeyed to view the Welsh mountains. “For
Christianity’s sake, help a poor man!” implored
an early traveller in Scotland, fainting by the
way. The door was slammed in his face.
“Surely you are Christians?” exclaimed the
unhappy man. “There are no Christians here,”
replied the half-savage Scot: “we are all Grants
and Frasers.” That last is, perhaps, rather a
savagely humorous than a true story, but the
mere existence of it is significant. More authentic—nay,
well established—is the statement that
even so late as 1749, in Glasgow, two people of
the same name would commonly be distinguished
by some physical peculiarity; or else, if one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
travelled and the other not, the one who had been
to the capital would be “London John,” or James,
according to what his Christian name might be.</p>

<p>A course of reading in the “travels” of the
authors and diarists who ambled about England,
on horseback or otherwise, in the old days,
sufficiently demonstrates the aloofness and isolation,
and the essential differences that divided the
country districts. When the Dukes of Somerset
resided at Petworth, in Sussex, the roads were so
bad that it was next to impossible to get there,
and when once there it was equally difficult to get
away. Petworth is only forty-nine miles from
London, but the Duke of Somerset maintained a
house at Godalming, sixteen miles along the road,
where he could halt on the way and pass the
night. His steward generally advised the servants
some time before his Grace started, so that they
might be on the road “to point out the holes.”
When the Emperor Charles VI. visited Petworth,
his carriage was attended by a strong escort of
Sussex peasants, to save it from falling over. In
spite of their efforts, it was several times overturned,
and that was a very sore and bruised
Emperor who supped that night with the Duke.
Similar adventures befel Prince George of Denmark,
husband of Queen Anne, visiting Petworth
from Windsor. He went in some state, with a
number of carriages. “The length of way was only
forty miles, but fourteen hours were consumed
in traversing it; while almost every mile was
signalised by the overturn of a carriage, or its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
temporary swamping in the mire. Even the
royal chariot would have fared no better than the
rest, had it not been for the relays of peasants
who poised and kept it erect by strength of arm,
and shouldered it forward the last nine miles,
in which tedious operation six good hours were
consumed.”</p>

<p>The travellers of that era, knowing how strange
the country must be to most people, gravely and
at length described places that in these intimate
times an author would feel himself constrained to
apologise for mentioning, except in a personal and
impressionistic way; and they not only so describe
them, but there is every reason to believe their
writings were read with interest. More interesting
than their dry bones of topographical history
are the accounts they give of manners, customs,
and thoughts common to the time when travellers
were few and little understood. When, in 1700,
the Reverend Mr. Brome, rector of the pleasant
Kentish village of Cheriton, determined to make
the explorations of England that took him, in all,
three years, he was obliged, as a matter of course,
to wait until the spring was well advanced and
the roads had again become passable. Setting
forth at last, one mild May day, his friends and
parishioners accompanied him a few miles, and
then, with the fervent “God be with you’s” that
were the parting salutations of the time, instead of
the lukewarm “Good-bye’s” of to-day, turned back
home-along, and expected to hear of him no more.
But he <em>did</em> return, as his very dull and jejune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
book, chiefly of stodgy historical and topographical
information, published in 1726, sufficiently
informs us.</p>

<p>“Weeping Cross” is the name of a spot just
outside Salisbury, supposed to have taken its
name from being the spot where friends and relatives
took leave of travellers, with little prospect
in their minds of seeing them again. There is
another “Weeping Cross” on the London side of
Shrewsbury, near Emstrey Bank, about a mile
from the town and overlooking the descending
road, whence the progress of the travellers could
be followed until distance at last hid them from
view. There are, doubtless, other places so
named throughout the country. The oft-repeated
legendary statement that travellers usually made
their wills before setting out is thus seen to be
reasonable enough, but it is specifically supported
by the author of <i>Letters from a Gentleman in the
North of Scotland</i>, who, writing about 1730, says:
“The Highlands are but little known, even to the
inhabitants of the low country of Scotland, for
they have ever dreaded the difficulties and dangers
of travelling among the mountains; and when
some extraordinary occasion has obliged any one
of them to such a progress, he has, generally
speaking, made his testament before he set out,
as though he were entering upon a long and
dangerous sea-voyage, wherein it was very doubtful
if he should ever return.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Calderwood, of Polton and Coltness,
made a journey from Scotland into England in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
1756, she wrote a diary, a very much more entertaining
and instructive affair than the Reverend
Mr. Brome’s book—which, indeed, could have been
compiled from other works without the necessity
of travelling, and, but for a few fleeting glimpses
of original observation, actually gives that impression.
Mrs. Calderwood tells us that at Durham
she went to see the Cathedral, where the woman
who conducted her round the building did not
understand her Scottish ways (nor indeed did Mrs.
Calderwood comprehend everything English). “I
suppose, by my questions, the woman took me for
a heathen, as I found she did not know of any
other mode of worship but her own; so, that she
might not think the Bishop’s chair defiled by my
sitting down in it, I told her I was a Christian,
though the way of worship in my country differed
from hers.” Mrs. Calderwood, quite obviously,
had never heard of St. Cuthbert and his antipathy
to women, so respected at Durham that womankind
were not admitted within certain boundaries
in his Cathedral church; nor was she familiar
with hassocks, for she narrates how the woman
“stared when I asked what the things were that
they kneeled upon, as they appeared to me to be
so many Cheshire cheeses.”</p>

<p>The modern tourist along our roads finds a
deadly sameness overspreading all parts of the
country. The same cheap little suburban houses
of stereotyped fashion, built to let at from £25 to
£30 a year, that sprawl in mile upon mile on the
outer ring of London, are to be found—nay, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
insistently to the foreground—wherever he goes.
They form the approach to, the outpost of, every
town, large or small, he enters, and are built
in the same way, and of the same materials,
whether he travels farther north, south, east,
or west. It was not so, need it be said, in the
old times. Then the coach passenger with an
eye for the beautiful and the unusual had that
sense abundantly gratified along almost every
mile of his course, for when men did not build
on contract, and when the contractor, had he
existed, would not have been able to work outside
his own district, there was individuality in
building design. We all know the truth of the
adage that “variety is charming,” and of variety
the travellers had their fill. And not only was
there variety in design, but an endless change
of materials gratified the eyes of those who cared
for these things. London, with its dingy brick,
was succeeded, as one penetrated westwards, by
the weather-boarded cottages of Brentford and
Hounslow, by the timber framing and brick
nogging of the next districts, by the chalk and
flint of Hampshire and Wilts; and at last, when
one had come to the stone country, by the yellow
ferruginous sandstone of Ham Hill, that characterises
the houses and cottages between Shaftesbury,
Crewkerne and Chard. Coming into Devon,
the yellow stone was replaced by the rich red
sandstone, or the equally red “cob” of that
western land; and a final change was found
when, the Tamar passed and Plymouth left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
behind, the massive granite churches, houses and
cottages astonished the new-comer to those parts.
No one could build with other than local materials
in those days. The material might be, like the
granite, stubborn and difficult, and expensive to
work, but it would have been still more expensive
to bring other materials to the spot, and so the
local men worked on their local stone, and in
course of time acquired that peculiar mastery
of it and that way of expressing themselves
which originated that “local style” whose secret
is so ardently sought by modern architectural
students. You cannot transplant the old style
of a locality. Like the wilding plucked from its
native hedgerow, it dies, or is cultivated into
something other than its original old sweet self
and becomes artificial. Cynic circumstance has
so decreed it that, while these ancient local
growths have in modern times been copied in
London and the great towns, the rural neighbourhoods
have been cursed with an ambition
to copy London, while everywhere cheap red
brick is ousting the native stone, flint, or wood.</p>

<p>When the fashionables travelled down by
coach to Bath, one might safely have offered a
prize for every brick house to be found there,
for Bath was, and is, built of the local oolite
known as “Bath stone.” The prize would never
have been claimed; but something like a modern
miracle is now happening, for even at Bath red
brick has underbid the native stone and gained
an entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Nothing escapes the modern desecrating touch.
“Auld Reekie” itself—Edinburgh, that last
stronghold of the Has Been—is not the same
“beloved town” that Sir Walter Scott knew.
The French Renaissance character of its grandiose
new buildings does not alone tend to change it
into something alien to sentiment and ancient
recollection; but that which our ancestors would
have thought a mere impossibility, that which
themselves would, and ourselves should, stigmatise
as a crime committed against History and the
Picturesque, has almost come to pass. In short,
the deep ravine where the Nor’ Loch stagnated
of old, where the Waverley Station is now placed,
has been deprived of something of its apparent
depth, and the Castle Rock of a corresponding
height, by the towering proportions of the vast
buildings that fill up the valley and desecrate
the site of the northern capital.</p>

<p>Sturdy survivals of olden days are the local
delicacies that first obtained a wider fame from
that time when they were set before the coach
passengers at the country inns where the coach
dined, or had tea, or supped, and were so greatly
appreciated that supplies were carried away for
the benefit of distant friends. Some, however,
of these delicacies have disappeared. No longer
does Grantham produce the cakes mentioned by
Thoresby in 1683. Grantham, he says, was
“famous in his esteem for Bishop Fox’s benefactions,
but it is chiefly noted of travellers for
a peculiar sort of thin cake, called ‘Grantham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Whetstones.’” What precisely were the cakes
known by this unpromising name we cannot
say, for the making of them is a thing of the
past.</p>

<p>Stilton cheese, never made at Stilton, obtained
its name exactly in the manner already described.
It was a cheese made at Wymondham, in Leicestershire,
but its merits were first discovered by the
coach-parties who dined at the “Bell” at Stilton,
whose landlord obtained his supply from Wymondham,
and drove a roaring trade in old cheeses sold
to the coaches to take away. “Stilton” cheese
is now only a conventional name, like that of
“Axminster” carpets, made nowadays at Kidderminster.</p>

<p>To bring home with him bags and boxes of
local delicacies was to the old coach-traveller as
much an earnest of his travels as the bringing
back of a storied alpenstock is to the tourist in
Switzerland. The Londoner, returning home from
Edinburgh, could come back laden with a number
of things which, easily obtainable now, were then
the spoils only of travel. From Scotch shortbread
the list would range to Doncaster butterscotch,
York hams, Grantham gingerbread, and
Stilton cheeses. On other roads he might secure
the cloying Banbury cake, still extant, and as
sickly-sweet and lavish of currants as of yore;
the famous Shrewsbury cakes, manufactured by
the immortal Pailin, who left his recipe behind
him, so that the cakes of Shrewsbury still continue
in the land; Bath buns, phenomenally adhesive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
and sprinkled with those fragments of loaf sugar
without which the exterior of no Bath bun is
complete; the cheese of Cheddar; the toffee of
Everton; pork pies from Melton Mowbray; or a
barrel of real natives from Whitstable. All or
any of these, I say, he might carry home with
him, while few places were so unimportant in
this particular way that he could not ring the
changes on gastronomic rarities as he went.</p>

<p>All these things were the products of that old
English tradition of good cheer and hospitality
which lasted even some little way into the railway
age. Journeys were cold, but hearts were warm,
and the more rigorous your travelling the better
your welcome. It would seem, and actually be,
absurd to surround a modern arrival by railway
with the circumstance that greeted the advent of
the coach. In the bygone times the guest had no
sooner alighted at his inn and proceeded to his
room than a knock came at his door, and lo! on
a tray a glass of the choicest port or cordial the
house contained. To this day the courteous old
custom survives at the “Three Tuns,” in Durham,
whose traditional glass of cherry brandy is famous
the whole length of the great road to the north.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“ALL RIGHT!” THE BATH MAIL TAKING UP THE MAIL-BAGS.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>From the contemporary lithograph.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>For the little folks who travelled by coach,
either with their own people or, like Tom Brown,
in charge of the guard, warm motherly hearts beat
in the bosoms of the stately landladies of the age,
all courteous punctilio to their grown-up guests,
but sympathy itself to the wearied youngsters.
Such was Mrs. Botham, of the “Pelican,” at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341<br /><a id="Page_342">342</a><br /><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Speenhamland, on the Bath Road—that “Pelican”
of whose “enormous bill” some waggish
poet had sung at an early period. Mrs. Botham,
an awesome figure—like Mrs. Ann Nelson, of the
“Bull,” Whitechapel, dressed in black satin—unbent
to the youngsters, for whom, indeed, she
had always ready a packet of brandy-snaps.</p>

<p>The earlier travellers were even more welcomed,
not by the innkeepers alone, whose
welcome was not altogether altruistic, but by
the country folk in general.</p>

<p>The annual reappearance of the early stage-coaches
was a much greater event to the villagers
and townsfolk of the more remote shires than we
moderns might suppose, or feel inclined to believe,
without inquiry. But we must consider the winter
isolation of such places in those remote times, and
then some faint glimmering sense of their aloofness
from the world will give us an understanding
of the relief with which they again saw real
strangers from the outer world. In the long
winter months, when days were short and roads
only to be travelled by the most daring horsemen,
spurred to the rash deed only by the most urgent
necessity, the passing stranger was rare, and excited
remark, and the company in the inn parlour
or by the ingle-nook discussed him, both because
of his rarity and by reason of their own raw
material for the making of conversation being
run very low indeed. We should be more thankful
than we generally are that our lot was not cast
in a seventeenth-century village, for winter in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
surroundings was dulness incarnate. Because they
could not obtain fodder to keep the sheep and
cattle in good condition through the winter, the
farmers and graziers of that time killed them
before that season set in, and the villagers lived
upon salted meat. Every house had its salt-beef
tub and its bacon-cratch under the kitchen ceiling,
well stocked with hams and sides; but vegetables
were so scarce as to be practically unobtainable.</p>

<p>Every household brewed its own beer and kept
a stock of cider, and most housewives were cunning
in the preparation of metheglin, a sickly-sweet
and heavy drink that revolts the modern palate,
but was then greatly appreciated. Evenings were
not long, even though it grew dark before four
o’clock, for folks went to bed by seven or eight.
There was little inducement to sit up late, because
only the feeblest illumination was possible to any
but the very rich, and the yeomen, the farmers
and the cottagers had to rest content with the dim
sputtering glimmer of the tallow dips that every
eight or ten minutes required the attentions of the
snuffers. “When the night cometh,” we read in
the Bible, “no man can work”; but that is a
statement which, literally true at the time when
the Bible was done into English, can now only
be read and understood figuratively. No one
could work by the artificial illumination then
possible.</p>

<p>Conceive, then, the joy with which returning
spring was greeted—spring, that brought back
light and fresh food and intercourse with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
world, outside the rural parish. Mankind had
travelled far from those prehistoric times of
annual terror, when the ignorant savage saw the
sun’s light going out with the coming of winter,
and so, with abject fear, passed the darkling
months until the vernal solstice brought him
hope again. No one in the Old England of two
hundred and fifty years ago trembled lest the sun
should not return at his appointed time; but when
the sap rose and the birds began to sing again,
and warmth and light had begun to replace the
fogs and mists of winter, the hearts of all rejoiced.</p>

<p>May Day was then the great merrymaking
festival, but the first coach that ventured along
the roads, now beginning to set after the winter’s
rains, had a welcome of its own. At Sutton-on-Trent,
on the Great North Road, the springtide
custom of welcoming the early coaches was
royally observed, and kept up for many years.
No coach, during a whole week of jollity, was
suffered to proceed through that jovial village
without it halted and ate and drank as only
Englishmen could then drink and eat. Guards,
coachmen and passengers were freely feasted,
willy-nilly. Young and old plied them with the
good things, spread out upon a tray covered with
a beautiful damask napkin, and heaped with
plum-cakes, tartlets, gingerbread, and exquisite
home-made bread and biscuits; while ale, currant
and gooseberry wines, cherry brandy, and occasionally
spirits, were eagerly pressed upon the
strangers. Half a dozen damsels, all enchanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
young people, neatly clad, rather shy, but courteously
importunate, plied the passengers.</p>

<p>Thoresby records a similar custom at Grantham,
near by, on one of his journeys. Under date of
May 4th, 1714, he says: “We dined at Grantham,
and had the usual solemnity, being the first passage
of the coach this season; the coachman and
horses decked with ribbons and flowers, and the
town music and young people in couples before
us.” The “town music” was what we should
nowadays call the Town Band.</p>

<p>When such courtesies obtained along the
roads the coachmen and guards would have been
churlish not to have, in some prominently visible
manner, done honour to the season. And, indeed,
May Day and springtime decorations were features
on most coaches. The coachman’s whipstock was
ornamented with gay ribbons and bunches of
flowers, while the coachman himself wore a floral
nosegay that rivalled a prize cabbage in size. The
guard was no less remarkable a figure, and his
horn was wreathed with the most lively display of
blossoms. Festoons of flowers and sprays of evergreens
so draped and covered the coach that the
insides, peering out upon the festivities, very
closely resembled those antic figures, the “Jacks-in-the-Green,”
that used on May Day to prance
and make merry from the midst of an embowering
canopy of foliage, even so late as thirty years ago,
in London streets. The horses, too, bore their part.
Their new harness and saddle-cloths, the rosettes
and wreaths of laurel on their heads, smartened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
them up so that even the animals themselves were
conscious of the occasion, and bore themselves
with becoming pride.</p>

<p>Those old customs are, as a matter of course,
gone. Coaches no longer dash through the old
“thoroughfare” villages; and when, with the
advent of spring, the motorist appears upon the
road, the villagers, rather than welcoming his
appearance, curse him for the clouds of dust he
leaves behind. Motor-cars, they tell us, are to
repeople the old coaching-roads, whose prosperity
is, through them, to return, and the picturesque
old wayside inns, with their memories of the
coaching age, are to once again experience the
rush of business. It may be so, but no one will
regret the fact more than the lover of Old England,
who, in the repeopling of the roads, sees
their modernising inevitable, and the equally
inevitable bringing “up to date” of those quaint,
quiet, and comfortable hostelries so dear to the
genuine tourist. It is true, they do not dine
you elaborately—as your extravagant motorist
complains—but life is not all chicken and champagne,
and it will be a sorry day when the plain
man, fleeing the gaudy glories of hotels at
fashionable resorts, finds the unsophisticated inns
of the countryside remodelled on the same plan.
Already the picturesqueness of the old roads is
threatened. They are, if you please, too hilly,
too narrow, or not straight enough for that new
tyrant of the highways, the owner of a high-powered
motor-car, and plans have actually been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
drawn up by irresponsible busybodies for straight
and broad new tracks, or for the remodelling of
the old roads on the same principle. Roadside
trees and avenues keep the surface damp and
muddy after rain, and so, as rubber-tyred cars
are apt to skid and side-slip on mud, the same
voices call for the abolition of wayside trees.
Old England is in a parlous state, when these
things can be advocated and no indignant protests
rise.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
